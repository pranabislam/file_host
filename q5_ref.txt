Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A person .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
There she is .
So meet Al .
A few less .
Nice one .
The sun .
Tree .
Not exactly .
Go !
Person .
Thank you .
Come on a journey with me .
No, it didn't .
So here it is .
Thank you so much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Yes, well ...
Thank you very much .
Oh, my God .
AB: Thanks .
How about fitness ?
Here is the video .
But you know what ?
A real school .
We were poor .
Yeah . Okay .
Is that something ?
Thank you guys .
Creativity .
after one week .
From Seattle ...
What a fish .
Sort of .
Genius .
Your daughter ?
The moon .
Wooo !
Really .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Hey, why not ?
But it hadn't .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
How to do it ?
It feels great .
And I understand that .
Here is mine .
It was faster .
It is beautiful .
It was crazy .
A Japanese person .
You are ready ?
Raw data .
Is that all ?
I represent children .
I swear .
Explore .
Very different notion .
No kidding .
Not very sustainable .
Very scary .
Your sister ?
Simple .
Everything is different now .
That's ammunition .
But there's another thing .
Thank you . Thank you .
We're losing them .
It's everywhere .
I don't know .
This would have been fine .
It's a lot .
Quite a few more .
And here is a surprise .
Yes, there it is .
Why do we do that ?
I don't know .
It's personal .
This is a trick .
That's huge .
The answer was no .
Do not do that .
It's true !
The answer is easy .
The data came back .
We are the soil .
But you know what ?
after only one trip .
Ohhhh .
Oh, my God !
It's true .
Solar technology is ...
It is generic .
So they know everything .
You could see Manhattan .
These changes are coming .
He answers the door .
Oh, that guy .
Robert Gupta .
It's horrible .
Play's essential .
My hunches again .
I don't know .
We're taking off .
Peace . Thank you .
Now, they are leaders .
This is a nice building .
It was all very normal .
I'm totally with you .
I don't think so .
Aww, thank you .
Okay . Thank you very much .
They're using their hands .
Now look at this curve .
They sort of go like this .
But how do we do that ?
Thank you .
Will you ?
We know that .
They called me .
That was us .
This is not ...
But many die .
Guess what ?
Or maybe not .
Nothing happens .
Is she conscious ?
What was the result ?
This is really exciting .
And that's it . Thank you .
Disgraceful . Disgraceful .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Is it your wife ?
And it took 18 months .
So where do we go ?
That's super important .
DK: 60,000 .
How do we know that ?
Tremendously exciting .
The farm's incredible .
Ta-da !
It makes them feel good ."
And why is it true ?
Who does the very best ?
It's a crisis .
Listen to understand .
What would you say ?
This is the cord .
What happens is this .
This is a mountain .
This is a tree .
You get a mouth .
It could take months .
You can be extraordinary .
We activate communities .
1,000, very good .
Pretty simple .
It has sensors .
Is that your opinion ?
But it gets worse .
Which was awesome .
CA: 60,000 .
This is really cool ."
But the point is ...
Trust is the response .
What about longevity ?
Here's the building working .
Now, who's normal ?
This is a lot of volume .
Tremendously challenging .
I want to ask a question .
There are . There always are .
Same thing, only bigger .
You are speaking your truth .
I have to use words .
Each of us is conscious .
Let's do this .
So how does this work ?
That's his name .
Obi-Wan .
And the answer is no .
He starts this new life .
Extraordinary .
I was so scared .
Okay, a bit more .
The first: Cut .
But they do the job .
What will these people want ?
Have you seen these guys ?
And that's important .
Who are these cousins ?
Ban is blank .
JK: Both .
That's very good .
He liked it very much .
The match begins -- silence .
So, Superman can fly .
as the greatest people in the world .
Dark urine . Dark .
The data says it all the time .
Doesn't happen very much .
I'm not for that .
Yes, I must mention it .
It makes life hard for us .
And I know why it happens .
Why are you still standing there ?
We are going to be okay .
You can see all of this .
I was exposed to him .
He screamed a lot .
Just go and read her book .
That's the whole idea .
They had to get out quickly .
This is Stephen Watt .
So here's another example .
Is it something about the light ?
It can know where we are .
I don't believe that .
Thank you very much, guys .
Tom: I'm Tom .
So, here's what happens .
So just imagine that for a moment .
You can go all the way through .
I'm going to stop that .
All right, let's go .
But what are we doing with it ?
Somehow this isn't working .
We could align ourselves with it .
This is the thing about symbols .
I'm quite fond of it .
You know, you can choose your list .
Or, is it, perhaps, possible ?
One of two things is going to happen .
So let's pull up some video .
So I'm just going to enter in .
Oh, it's so familiar to me .
Done .
We love innovation .
And they did .
Not good enough .
I felt great .
People were going crazy .
What did they do ?
There is no feed .
And this was fascinating .
Maybe 10 times more .
Why not live longer ?
I was amazed .
It keeps you fresh .
Score them again .
And so I did .
Now, I understand it . I do understand it .
My name is Amit .
Actually, for 10 years .
And I was very proud .
And here I am today .
We have three main groups .
Three times out of 10 .
There are billions of them .
Centers were established .
I was devastated .
So Scott gets this call .
And that's nothing .
That's scary .
An almost identical structure .
And that worked pretty well .
You can enter inside it .
Here you see the city .
These guys make money .
Just be who you are .
He had had the experience .
I wanted to support them .
Because, you know something ?
Jack is our favorite ."
Hard is hard .
And he leapt .
One was Jason .
All right, ready ?
Why are we conscious ?
And you love it .
But we need more .
I pushed back .
Not that catchy .
We have zero infrastructure .
That was a powerful moment .
And here's the thing .
The only country in the world .
It's interesting to me .
It's completely directed .
That's very risky .
And then he says three words .
Now how could this come about ?
Good afternoon, everybody .
It really comes from these artists .
Want to feed the world ?
2.5 to one, great .
Let's call him Don .
Pretty good, right ?
How do we do that ?
I was kind of extreme .
It doesn't exist .
That moment changed my life .
He never made it there .
Man: Oh ! Oh !
Fans want that experience .
No, not like that .
I am not my father .
Like father, like son .
This is really tough stuff .
And I looked like this .
But there was a problem .
No Shakespeare .
It was a beautiful day .
My dream was coming true .
They didn't know .
that are full of understanding .
It's in Seattle .
It's part of our life .
We need to get the message out .
I'm an expert in relationships ."
Now, this sounds crazy, right ?
Right ? So you can do it .
So that's the good news .
It is the criteria .
Horrible, absolutely horrible .
Who have you got in mind ?
It is absolutely gorgeous .
It's about concrete .
My family believes in me .
Here's what it said .
You hear it all the time .
Why choose this as our goal ?
For a year . A year .
It must always be in motion .
Then there's the danger .
Who cleans up after us ?
I want to make them public .
And I will talk about this .
ML: Thanks, Tom .
It may even be your story .
She also had duplicates .
You don't want to do that ?
Let's take a step back .
This is Jason Garber .
But they were right, you know .
It's not enough by itself .
They have lower self-esteem .
It's Sunday night .
She absolutely loves her reflection .
This I thought I could handle .
We're going to be okay ."
So this is our reconstruction .
But the reality is far from it .
ML: Absolutely .
This young child is eight years old .
You have to create a new profession .
And there's hundreds of them .
I mean, that was epic .
I talk a lot about these issues .
Mark Bezos: Thank you .
That's easy, huh ?
Imagine then just two other little changes .
Now this is one of the images .
It turns out to be really difficult .
So let's think about the atoms .
Have a look what she's doing .
And it's been an incredible experience .
My cousins would be running around everywhere .
And she's hitting a 257.
The second mistake that I made was worse .
It's 150 feet by 10 feet .
He has a selective one, though .
It's about time . Thank you .
Let's be a part of this .
So let's start with Sunday .
But play's a shapeshifter .
That's headed up to about nine billion .
I could see in her eyes, it was terror .
Thank you so much .RT: Thank you .
So, I'm going to wrap up now .
What happened ?
I actually am .
So what happened ?
Everybody loved me .
Remember fire ?
Here's why .
And we've got such a long way to go with this .
Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today .
She did it in secret .
So let me recap .
Think about your own choices .
How could we help you ?"
There were remixes .
There were still fishes .
I sometimes push too hard .
It connected those two people .
So this is for real .
Your plant can blow up .
And it even got better .
But it was very sad .
Can I be honest ?
And I was an artist .
She can have fun .
We want that experience ."
This is Ohio .
You can guess this .
It is not 1961.
He eventually gets married .
We take photos constantly .
I lost all hope .
We love entertainment .
BG: Thank you .
I resisted it .
He turns off the engines .
So you can have this cloud .
You saw the big peak .
You can zoom around very simply .
And I grew up in India .
It is a completely different notion .
"Best in the business ."
Okay, we can do that .
It's not a country .
And it's pretty amazing .
And it was a huge success .
They sell certificates .
The ball comes off track .
It was more entertaining .
And that got me thinking .
Hard problems are hard .
And then I did it .
I needed to go deeper .
That was awkward .
He told me two things .
These girls were so lucky .
I was so shocked .
So I had an idea .
But they mean two different things .
Chris Kluwe: Go .
And I got pretty into it .
Okay . Open your eyes .
They are so easy to help .
Isn't that true ?
We are in excellent company .
The forest was sparkling .
I believe he is selling hope .
So I became a comic .
And everyone was doing the same .
It was more like a restaurant .
You can see the water coming .
But I will do a trial .
Ha . He's ready .
So they kill the lions .
They kill our livestock .
Privacy is implied .
Why did I go into medicine ?
She was back and near death .
Well she was back all right .
They stopped us from being inspired .
It's not our struggle .
It's not our problem .
Let's call him Don too .
He only has use of his eyes .
I've lived a good life .
It's called The Cloud .
You can play with a different type .
Let's starting with sensing .
We went and looked at a site .
So that's a tough one .
Who's going to be sure ?
First, we've got population .
It was really, really quite profound .
I don't love that question .
Suicide is preventable .
So this crazy story might be true .
There are also tons of collaborators .
And he actually says it that way .
His name is Paul Offit .
And that can make a big difference .
How about that pancake ?"
I would have that hard conversation .
And that is a terrible feeling .
I changed my dosages .
Many are not so fortunate .
Many are not so fortunate .
You can see every step I take .
My parents are closing in on 80 .
Number one: Be authentic .
But what if you are that person ?
What do these two have in common ?
That's Hollywood for you .
So may books be always with you .
But that's so unfair .
That's one way to go .
We got to our campsite .
Maybe a year passes, nothing .
It's about all of us .
MK: I can help you .
We see all the same symptoms .
And the garden, it was beautiful .
My name is Brian Goldman .
But, but, you know what ?
And it opens up a map .
This was my first sunburn .
And there's good news here .
You're an inspiring person .
We've been disconnected .
So go ahead and start inventing .
Let me show you how they work .
We vanquished it . Puff .
Oh, you've heard of that .
And it's a very easy question .
I'm not sure where we go .
You see the timeline on the top .
I want to help you calm down .
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you .
Oh, that's all my time ?
A lot of my clients are very young .
It would be unconscionable .
Here's their jam aisle .
Now it turns out you're right .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
That's 20 Central Parks .
And when we do this, who knows ?
So do you still not want to continue ?"
A hundred and forty-seven .
It was very time-consuming .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
This is a person going for a walk .
On the left, we have a woman .
It's there right at its heart .
It's just not going to happen .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And you know what ? You're wrong .
I'll get my sleeve back .
There seems to be a discrepancy .
Thank you, Danny Kahneman .
But in practice, how do you do it ?
as to what the subject matter would actually be .
So, if you could bring up the lights .
And that title was "President ."
Yeah .
Like twice over .
They all matter .
Does that sound good ?
Free at last ! Free at last !
Possibly with endless breadsticks .
The result of that has been disastrous .
It might sound like it's a bad thing .
But I'm going to ask you a question .
That's why it's on the street .
They're throwing it up in the air .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Absolutely . Absolutely, I do .
It's all coming out of our own pockets .
We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone .
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
And I thought about that .
Many of them drown .
So I set up everything .
And his answer was yes .
We have online criminals .
And then it happened again .
And the family gathered .
And I felt really good .
Her mother raised her alone .
And then it went international .
You always lose rare animals .
It will get to you .
So I made one .
Well, I was next .
I see this plus sign .
Will I like the color ?
There's no normal .
These are huge questions .
It was grit .
I turned to books .
The economy needs them .
Hold it up .
Today I am 22.
Go home to where ?
I like things that are different .
She shares her experience with others .
And I went back to work .
And I memorized everything .
So what was the next step ?
We worked well into each night .
He is my grandfather .
He retreated into silence .
He was actually collecting fish .
Let me give you an example .
I had written these crazy things .
I couldn't bear it .
They pretty much do nothing .
Man: Um, my brand ?
I wanted to keep us healthy .
She did it for three years .
And it really changed the dynamic .
This is an ecological network .
There's almost nothing left .
We made this game in 2007.
There should be an understanding .
I could be that person ."
These are just tricks .
It never stops coming .
He has a purpose in life .
Would you know what to say ?
They don't want that .
Well, that's simple .
What's going on here ?
I think these people are experts .
That's procrastination .
My dream would never come true .
So so much for the aim .
It was just three days away .
Could it be so simple though ?
We're proud of you ."
They're all important choices ."
What does she suffer from ?
And we were live, right ?
And why are these<<unk>> there ?
What's going on here ?
This is a family portrait .
This person has never been born .
The book was published in 2009.
And here's me today .
I live in South Central .
I thought my life was over .
Okay, there's some .
That's cool, huh ?
But there are two problems with that .
And those are the neural structures .
It's not moving like that .
And we built an iPad application .
KA: What does it mean ?
Even cats were watching this video .
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
But it's not documented .
You should ask for some of that .
Goodnight sweet opossum ."
It's spreading virally .
I'm actually an engineer .
What other brands are like that ?
Isn't that awesome ?
And so we measured its motion .
And I've never seen them .
He showed it to Javier .
Do we really want to go there ?
They had a concept of blue blood .
You have that much uncertainty .
And let me begin with one example .
They flooded the canals .
And then they execute on it .
I need you to actually see this .
You know science isn't a company .
So, Paul's a terrorist .
Not even the truth will set them free .
But there's another reason as well .
Never apologize for that .
But we came across a new phenomenon .
She is no more a free individual .
They want to be their favorite player .
So I go in a different direction .
It's a vacation community .
It's a talking horse .
What am I going to look at ?
I want more quests like that .
What would such a future look like ?
It's a remarkable statistic .
They sought people like him out .
Would I have become a terrorist ?
He is introduced to this young woman .
I didn't get the part .
All this is possible with this information .
Who sends whom a text message ?
Now don't get me wrong .
See, I'm an artist .
It might take a moment to load .
Like me, they are dreaming big .
We had a victory on our hands .
I don't take the same history .
That's the system that we have .
And they don't tell us much .
Something really weird is going on here .
You can have a succession of changes .
This was the sailfin grouper .
"A Pale Blue Dot ."
He kept pacing back and forth .
And there is this stunning silence .
That was the first upright primate .
Huh . Hang on a moment .
They need to tell me about my brand .
And it's also very risky .
MS: Okay . Awesome .
So that was the reason for the project .
I've got something to show you .
But then you really want to go deep .
And even Lomborg has changed .
And so that's a big challenge .
He pointed at the algae .
The chef had overcooked it .
And there it was, a great revolution .
Government ? Forget about it !
No one knows what the hell we do .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
That's a little bit scary .
You can all give your own examples there .
But that's not how it happens .
So let's look at the numbers .
Eleven . It's not bad .
Dwarves became columns .
But it's also damaging health .
Fans want to be on that field .
Oh my God ! Aaaah !
Fans want to be on the field .
Kevin is straight, as he says .
The world turned into a big black hole .
So I couldn't handle it .
I mean, I'm a journalist .
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
And the form has something to do with it .
Let me give you good close look at this .
It doesn't taste very good either .
We've won a bunch of awards .
So again, that was a real good match .
Chris Anderson: I've got a question .
The bricks are color-coded .
He's the dude on the left .
And who could have predicted any of this ?
The more it changes, the faster it changes .
The company headquarters are right here .
What's the next one on your list ?
It's really become sacred to us .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
I want to believe that Paulie was right .
This is how stuff is made memorable .
But let's show our kids the truth .
I knew then how to self-identify .
And I have all sorts of little props here .
I'm going to go ahead and select government .
You hope you don't need to do that .
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive .
So Scott was speaking person-to-person .
So let's project this analogy going forward .
Now I've been talking a lot about magic .
That's the work that stands before us .
We are so close to being able to do this .
There's world records that are on this as well .
And you know what my response to all of that is ?
In fact, their life depended on doing the job .
You don't get a chance to mess it up .
Do you know what I'm talking about ? Yeah .
I was like, this is unbelievable .
I'm like, "What ? No . Why ?"
It's one tragedy compounding another .
But, what's the problem with all of this ?
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
OK, good, so we have some gamers among us .
We've got to put that bear in a cage .
I don't know what I'm supposed to do .
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't .
It's all here; it's all on the web .
I really want to see some twentysomethings here .
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster .
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
He was waiting .
So what happens here ?
So what happened here ?
I was never caught .
Kills everybody inside .
and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh .
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .
Come, dance with me . Come, dance with me .' " Thank you .
"Yes," he said .
Next would be nuclear .
So this is a wish .
One is South Korea .
Is it just imaginary ?
Some have come and gone .
I never will forget it .
I will never forget it .
And many people forget this .
So how does it happen ?
He died broken by history .
Or is it photography ?
Were we being followed ?
So I broke the silence .
This was the very first .
So why did they go ?
What else can they record ?
So, I just started playing .
Finally: epic meaning .
They're feasting ."
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
You have not changed the story .
That does not hold for emotions .
And this video is real time .
Everybody applauded politely .
This picture's from there .
Italy wins . Yeah .
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
I went to prison -- difficult .
Woman: Superior technology .
They were still kind of happy .
And this made me really sad .
This is happening to us today .
Because I have nothing to hide ."
And I said, "Yes ."
Talk about what you heard here .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
Just because it sounds so good .
You know when to expect them .
This is something from a novel .
And I think there are three .
Now thirdly, the task .
went through three temptations .
So try to meet that bar .
This is what suicide does .
We talk about it ambivalently .
It's just better than reality .
This is true . I believe this .
They are building an epic story .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
This is World Without Oil .
He shook his head, no .
I could draw . I could paint .
So with that, I thank you .
It's been constantly going up .
It is kind of a crazy idea .
Monday: Color is powerful .
And really you do the same thing .
This is a photograph of the object .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
These will be irresistible .
LEGO made it accessible .
This is a modest little app .
I mean, it's fascinating .
I mean, it's fascinating .
It's not our burden .
And I began giving her my rap .
I call it the rising billion .
It was not drowned yet .
So I followed my hunches .
And it was what I was feeling .
And he was very, very sorry .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
And I was distraught .
in the cold, windy night .
How does light look in slow motion ?
Take a moment to say thank you .
Jealousy likes photos .
That's a perfectly rational thing .
I gave out homework assignments .
It did not start that trend .
Why do we have these inner movies ?
And I said, "What speech ?"
Just wanted to drop you a note .
There is help . There is hope .
What would we be capable of then ?
The machines would rise up against us .
We have measles in this country now .
No one's ever said that before .
You can drill into a particular year .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
So, what do we have to do ?
We need to go for more research funding .
And I had to get out of town .
You can be logical and intuitive .
It's morning, before the match .
Raise your hands . Let me see .
Who doesn't want healthier children ?
No, that's what I thought .
But what this image represents was the problem .
A: Tell me about this world .
And that was 19 yeas ago .
And you know what I've learned ?
So littleBits is open-source .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
Now we didn't write this app .
We truly are living in an extraordinary time .
And let me show you a simple example .
But it does require a lot of planning .
I am a redefined physician .
What do you do with certificates ?
Several times we can repeat that .
Well you can see where this is going .
We don't work from offices .
They got their title of respectability .
And now I can stand on my head .
It's about creating a social impact .
And what does jealousy like ?
The novel is very good on this point .
We could go to Mars if we want .
But I didn't handle it .
Three trees together, we create the forest .
Two suns together, prosperous .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
He is our very first starchitect .
These are not trivial activities .
I am not here to inspire you .
What would that look like on the field ?
Hundreds of schools were lost .
So let me set this up for you .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
We're trying to prevent an impact .
And it just disturbed me so much .
Music is medicine . Music changes us .
What we want to do is make the future .
And I see Greg LeMond now .
Daniel Kahneman: Sure .
And then what do you do with the waste ?
Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
We don't have that kind of situation .
And here you can see Roberto dancing .
So you can reconstruct a whole movement .
The goal of this whole film is transparency .
Tell me a little bit about that part .
So that made sense, that was a match .
This is about one percent of the total population .
Play is not just child's games .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
Politics is not changing; government is changing .
And we've had some fantastic presentations .
And that's a very sensible question .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
It's a game called Foldit .
We have the tools with this exponential technology .
I didn't know the protocols .
For a year we were penniless .
We're right at that point of transition .
I'm human . I make mistakes .
I'm still breaking the silence today .
He has the most impeccable memory .
And, you know, it could have worked .
Now you can learn three interesting things from this .
And what about some still-life photography ?
"Yo, is she retarded ?"
I'm not really sure about the answer .
That's really bad for the worker .
And their work lets us do our work .
They are almost a form of reassurance .
Jealousy is exhausting .
And, of course, it's difficult .
You're deciding your life right now .
And I met a host of really interesting people .
This is my niece, Stella .
Science, by its nature, is objective .
It's gone . It's vanished .
It's kind of like a potato .
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
Here are two patients, those are their recordings .
There's a lot that has to come together .
I've got it here on my laptop ."
That wouldn't have been a problem at all .
I want to tell you how we found that out .
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
So that worked . So booya for Scott .
And there's a very good reason for that .
It's about the nuance of human language .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
Over here, these are the Apsaras .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
It was like the foreman of the jury .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
And I also ask myself, does it really work ?
Here's a story about how that can go .
Yeah, I know . What a contradiction .
Well, imagine you're the quarterback .
There's a lot of techniques in this approach .
It's more than that; it's deeper .
The best is yet to come -- so in a second .
And that's been my humbling experience in this .
But then reality's always unpredictable .
And I'm going to admit something to you .
We have the passion of the DIY innovator .
I didn't know how to talk about wine .
We're harnessing energy from the sun .
The other one had a lot of diarrhea .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
It doesn't take long to think about a building .
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective .
Here's the updated version of this entry .
So this is all of the meta-data information .
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you .
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up .
There's step-by-step instructions on this .
A: What's the next one you want to talk about ?
Your niece ?
Sound familiar ? Right .
This is an old study .
What defines a story ?
I remember my first fire .
He kept pointing here .
What is it, then ?
I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali .
My friend got to come .
But I never got cast .
And that's architecture .
What would that be like ?
So why does that matter ?
What do you think happened then ?
What do you think happens next ?
I almost never cook with it .
I think this is really cool .
Keep going . Have fun .
This data was not available before .
How many people would choose creativity ?
How many would opt for memory ?
All the adults knew the risks .
I lived in parallel worlds .
No had never been an option .
We asked around and nobody knew .
Not everybody gets to do that .
Let me tell you a secret .
There were no back doors .
My big break came in 2010 .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
Other teams followed suit .
And what happens at the end ?
You stood for the right cause .
Are you still smart or not ?
You think the Internet was big .
This has nothing to do with science .
Let me read you the entry .
Maybe we can see it as change .
And women successfully argued that .
Is it going to be my size ?
And apparently it was quite popular .
I probably shouldn't say that .
That means something built in a city .
How about living longer with good health ?
Imagine a plane full of smoke .
So the white lines here are population .
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
It's called batting average .
Plus you get strawberries .
They are bird-blending machines .
We're working with local communities .
And I thought about death a lot .
They have nothing to compare it to .
Some other heroes can become invisible .
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
But it is not only about me .
But his story takes a different route .
Jealousy likes information .
Jealousy likes details .
Freud would write about this later .
We live in jealous times .
There's no models for them .
Do you know Britney Spears ?"
Maybe we even know a baker .
They work because they make you work .
And the thing is, I am .
And you know what he told me ?
He said, "You listened .
I think we all have closets .
Don't take anything for granted .
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I hold the knife in my hand .
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
This is the one with the greatest impact .
Chris Anderson: Thank you . Thank you .
So, we can give ourselves a gift .
But I don't buy anything new .
You want to navigate around the museum ?
It's to supplement the experience .
Sexual reproduction enters the picture .
I was trying to preserve the body .
What are you going to do with it ?"
That's the two-cent tour .
MS: That is a fantastic question .
Didn't make sense to me .
Play is not frivolous .
They haven't given up on government .
Do you want to come over and listen ?"
Crisis . Death . Disaster .
Something stiffened inside me .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
Defeat would have come too easily .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Now we do the same with airplanes .
The shores are from a different location .
But I carried on with my work .
They put her on a ventilator .
We can't get rid of it .
The third technique: Categorization .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
He wasn't alone when he started .
Some people just wanted to call him King .
So we started retouching photos .
You have to fight for it every day .
So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
I wanted to understand who takes the job .
Jealousy baffles me .
The Bible is interesting, but strange .
Two women together, they have an argument .
And then, follow me into your kitchen .
And where are they looking to for inspiration ?
Why is there this inner subjective movie ?
Can you get this on a running back ?
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
And you observe a really strange effect .
Another important consequence is goal seeking .
There's never been a time like this .
That guy in the middle, not so much .
It's cruel to millions of people .
They divided the entire kingdom in half .
Amazingly, it was still delicious .
What's the feed conversion ratio ?"
Feasting ? I was totally confused .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
We have something that's not going up .
So here we have some natural fireflies .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
It's something we knew how to do .
Both are viable; both take off .
They're in the back of our body .
They even can bring with them some financing .
They're becoming like computers in open air .
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand .
KF: That's a great question .
So we start with a Windows dropper .
But wait, this is actually my favorite project .
And these women would get together and just talk .
So there's an opportunity to change that .
And this is about shifting baseline .
It can know how we're holding it .
And I put my challenge on 95 kg .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
So it's feeding back on itself .
One I thought had a kidney stone .
They had 348 different kinds of jam .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
I thought my heart was going to explode .
And let that be your weapon of choice .
I'm always the one taking the picture .
I couldn't offer them any direct help .
This is only virtual reality, V .R .
It's really the most scary thing .
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
My grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
And this took me awhile to figure out .
Because we don't want to move genes around ?
I don't get that feedback in real life .
We do not want to try to predict the future .
So, let me give you a little peek .
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them .
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
And it's not just in terms of sex .
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
And that was the onset of ALS .
Thank you guys very much . That was awesome .
You know how many people watch these TED Talks ?
I'm going to deal directly with the artist .
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
We don't really know very much about it .
We don't like to talk about our history .
I said, "I'm going to listen ."
What about contributions we can't even predict ?
And it's very important for research in medicine .
And here every piece is very well planned .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
It's a complete denial of mistakes .
And it starts with one physician at a time .
They're our natural garbage collectors .
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
I wasn't a citizen of that country .
ML: It's much better than that .
We had an amazing local woman who guided us .
But there's also something funny going on here .
Oh, yay ! You are all awesome .
This crowd is going to be fine, I think .
And who's going to earn the most money ?
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes .
It's an amazing multi-track movie .
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary .
We need to learn how to take this step together .
Do not give them that sense of false hope .
It's hard to overstate the destruction .
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line .
So again, which potential do we want to bring out ?
So sex can come in lots of different varieties .
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
Here is where we were, and this is the painting .
It was four and a half years ago in Italy .
And it made all the sense in the world to me .
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz .
It's just a quick video of what we do .
We have to engage with the machinery of government .
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher .
Here are two different jewelry displays .
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay ?
I'm just one woman with a story to tell .
This wasn't a brothel, per se .
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up ?
They don't work as they're supposed to .
Books banned in China, of course .
That's how we end up with buildings like this .
And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore .
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart .
And they're not just going to die of measles .
Yes, you're right . Let's fix it .
That's the problem that I'm trying to solve .
How's that look out there ? Pretty good .
It's really old, and it's tired .
The rest of the time they're delocalized .
Play is the glue that binds us together .
I didn't know how to use the cutlery .
Alone, ashamed and unsupported .
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
I don't know if you've heard of this .
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes .
The bad news is that most of them don't work .
And this work has been wonderful . It's been great .
You don't know where it's going to land .
They need it, and we're not giving it to them .
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
We've just been waiting for all of you to want them .
This opens up the way for you to do science with it .
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually .
How do we get to augmented reality, A .R . ?
There's an economist named Edward Castronova .
If you actually want to make a difference, you have to do something .
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around .
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second .
but "How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ?"
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series .
It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year .
Be a mentor .
How engaged you are .
Why should I worry ?
So that started the journey .
What creates the illusion ?
And then somebody complained .
They were seeing something magical .
I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it .
We certainly need one to succeed .
I like really nice clothes .
Now we talk about water wars .
He needed them to feel protected .
Remi knows what love is .
They only hired perfect people .
Everyone asks about the smell .
It offers many insights .
I never would have expected that .
In 1997, this building opened .
But my daughter never complained .
And so that got me very excited .
So the correlation is low .
The disaster is for that two billion .
The roof also is covered with water .
Which one would you like the most ?
Just spread it as wide as possible .
Today, there are 2.3 million .
Because we live on a water planet .
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
This is a dead turtle .
My mother phoned minutes later .
And every morning I hop on it .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
I began to feel a bit better .
But today, it goes beyond that .
We did not prioritize right .
So, why did I do that ?
But most people don't agree .
Disability is as visual as race .
But I like contingency plans .
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon .
Do you trust fishmongers ?
He was only three at the time .
Airbrushing is now routine .
How do we take that next step ?
Architects and engineers, thankfully .
What ? That really flipped me out .
How are you going to feed the world ?
We talk about drowning in data .
That's a painting of a circle .
And so that's what we did .
Let me tell you a bit about it .
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.
Here are the results we just obtained .
I wanted to restore health from disease .
So I guess that's my brand .
People seem to think politics is sexy .
They had to worry about being bombed .
We're constantly running into each other .
And I thought I could blend in .
And one time we caught a live one .
Life hadn't changed for centuries .
That's about all it can do .
Actually, I made two more mistakes .
The three words are: Do you remember ?
And fortunately he didn't die .
We have to gradually increase the complexity .
and issue rogue certificates .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
And I started a new life yet again .
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
I got tired of seeing this happening .
The question, "Why does she stay ?"
This should be the first principle of aid .
There is a problem with community meetings .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
So I started a research project with them .
They wear a uniform in many cities .
So, we used to solve big problems .
I don't have an overview .
Well, we can do that for ourselves .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
So I started reading books in pairs .
This is a guy called E .P .
Well I say, more power to him .
Good luck this week . Vicky ."
This kind of thinking isn't new .
Ask anybody I have ever dated .
That is their story, not yours .
They manage the process, they understand the process .
Everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
We made it over the last 11,000 years .
And why ? Genetically engineered food .
And this is a classic gaming emotion .
Blissful productivity . I love it .
Dosage has something to do with this .
I can't, but this guy can .
The flamingos eat the shrimp .
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable ."
Unfortunately, it's not much better .
We'll come back to these people later .
I call this "Shiny Tiger ."
Here, let me give you an analogy .
You look around at all these museums here .
It's called "Talk to Me ."
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
We have reached a kind of equipoise .
Make it possible, everyone in this room .
And that's what these brands did .
And we say that word with such contempt .
I know this might be broadcast broadly .
And yet, there is this disconnect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
We're trying to reduce the prison population .
It's just taught me very simple things .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
And we've seen this in cellphones .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
And somehow kids don't do that anymore .
I'm here to share my photography .
Save those . Kill off the rest .
Introduce some mutations perhaps .
They're obscure, weird programs .
Who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
It's a question of freedom against control .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
Also the noise will disappear in these pores .
So a microwave is a similar system .
Let's see . Yeah, it worked .
So what is the problem with vultures ?
First question to answer for us: so what ?
I couldn't give them money, nothing .
We're pale, gray creatures .
Can they really store all this information about us ?
I have cerebral palsy !
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
And then there's the stigma .
And that would be a perfectly sensible response .
It's not what I would aim at .
Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
A map actually carries somebody's view .
Two fires together, I get really hot .
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
It's not a science of explanations .
They are not things to do with our bodies .
Now how do we get to augmented reality ?
You take the snap and you drop back .
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit .
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk .
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing .
And as I move around my finger shifts .
But I didn't let that daunt me .
There's just no way of getting it right .
It has moments of experience, one after the other .
And you can ask: What happens to these moments ?
That really is very important, that we get there .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
So I think we have to be in the lead .
But just substitute apartment building for cities .
We have been here for about 130,000 years .
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
There's no hospital that can say "No ."
You see, I had this idea for a movie .
The film hasn't even been distributed yet .
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency .
So he's getting citizens to check on them .
I do get tired, as we all do .
Jeopardy's not an easy game .
They were maturing at five centimeters .
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
I didn't know how to talk about anything .
As of next week, it will soon be available .
It's about as far as we go out .
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
"I'm not helping you," he said .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
We need to work with governments in regional levels .
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully .
Thinking about death clarifies your life .
Something to do with words, I assume .
And so the Senate won in the end .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up !
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
They are the first guardians of public health .
It came to be known as the memory palace .
The bodies can't be properly buried .
And we can't give you enough of it .
The New York Times called this building a miracle .
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far .
But this is still a science of correlations .
My prayers are with you for your fight .
If you know you are gay, just say it .
Here are some examples of Entropica in action .
Let's pretend right here we have a machine .
I have to say, I don't understand it .
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
But I'm going to focus on the demo .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
This guy's name is TEMPT .
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
We're more than that, we're citizens .
Ohhhhh, wowwww !
It always starts with a sketch, an idea .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
And she was barely breathing and she was blue .
Here's their olive oil aisle .
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
A day, a week ? Actually, a whole year .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out .
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities .
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school .
And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
We've come a long, long way since then .
Jason's parents had asked him to do so .
And the battle of gay relatability had begun .
But you know what you're not entitled to ?
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks .
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't .
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
We've all got navigation controls in our car .
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
And this is an argument, which doesn't make sense .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Let's go back to that time, to this city .
And I started talking to a few of the competitors .
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity .
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say .
But you can't count my fingers right now can you ?
Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically .
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different .
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions .
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it .
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last !"
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far .
The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here .
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical .
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward .
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it .
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do ."
Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat .
We victims need everyone .
And I tried something interesting .
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment .
But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me .
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about .
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period .
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to .
And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
I was in awe .
No expensive staff time required .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
Great memories are learned .
They literally flipped the switch .
But what are your fish eating ?
If you burn coal, no .
So what happened years afterward ?
Will it be under $20 ?
I represent people on death row .
So what happened on this day ?
This is not a finished story .
Now we see the opposite effect .
One of them was this grandmother .
Do they know where we live ?
But no adults liked the idea .
So what happened to Emma ?
Do you remember what it was ?"
And then, something amazing happened .
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly .
There's simply no privacy .
We do overcome some things .
There have been several close calls .
Do they do that for the children ?"
Now, that blew my mind .
If you burn natural gas, no .
People need to feel good about it .
What should our report card look like ?
The whole building is made of water .
How do I get this removed ?"
We love technology . We love creativity .
They had been pushed genetically .
I never knew him in real life .
"You have not let it go ."
And I kept asking myself these questions .
I even went through an identity crisis .
A morning that I will never forget .
Today I have just one request .
somebody else would love about this woman .
The aim is to have more trust .
And it wasn't social intelligence .
I call these eight characters radicals .
The bad ones have information overload .
It was called Talibanization .
Gamers don't sit around .
Five million people use it every month .
Thinking, you know, two percent .
They did it by draining the land .
One billion people will go hungry today .
And it completely changed how I do movies .
You can jump right into a specific issue .
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
And it also involved new choices for leaders .
Well, that's not quite right .
You zoom in . You really go in .
France scores . Italy scores .
These devices aren't accessible to people ."
The captain waved me over .
But perhaps that's not the case .
We think about energy scarcity .
It's this, just like this .
But so many over the years were helped .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
Some I even considered like my second home .
My interpreter told me their stories .
Can we see it in full 3D ?
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
It totally dominated her imagination for months .
At that point I also had a son .
These people must be freaks of nature .
Bakers have flour on their hands .
But there actually are no shortcuts .
We created an emotional reaction to these forms .
So did every mayor in the world .
These were the men I looked up to .
It has emotions, anger and happiness .
No knock on the neuroscientists .
But this is not yet augmented reality .
That determines good teams from bad .
They just want their own pain to end .
We just need to up the resolution .
Thanks . So imagine yourself 20 years ago .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
"Absolutely," I said .
And ecologically, it was a disaster .
There is a lot of happiness coaching .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
The world today has 6 .8 billion people .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
And, finally, this storage problem .

I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
Dearborn, Michigan . Henry Ford .
And after a few months went by, I realized that he was different .

It's also like a form of respiration or circulation .
But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing .
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that .

He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday .
A few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors .
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience, and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is significant, why it's colorful, when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers .
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr . P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people .
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed . I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right ?
Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said, "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, when he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy ."
In this picture, I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms: it has survived; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's working ! It's working !"
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony .
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally, or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field, and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house .
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan .
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art," I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake," I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "What about yours ?" and I would point the microphone towards them .
When I was working in the field, I brought lots of candles with me, and with the help of my interpreter, I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight, so when it was safe for them, and safe for me, I made these images .
This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication: So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday . Gotta get down on Friday . ♫ ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend . ♫ ♫ Friday, Friday . Gettin' down on Friday . ♫ KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
We proposed a building that was audacious, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared, so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, comment, like it, hate it .
I was 22, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the United States .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need ?
And since then, I've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of them with you .
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that's a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, that's collected anyway by the operator, in order to understand how the city works .
And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him .
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time," and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have . And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right ?
You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth .
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in, found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains, so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
Over the last few millenia, we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet, to the scroll, to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity .
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before, but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scanned, uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and it'd start being fixed .
But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that .
Now, would you choose the same vacation ? And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer .
Here he's seen taking a bath at the well, pouring big buckets of water over his head, and the wonderful news is, as you and I are sitting here talking today, Kofi has been reunited with his family, and what's even better, his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again ? Well that would be awesome ."
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar," which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG, and the main characters would all be in CG, and the world would be in CG .
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, Newton's laws — so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern .
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing, it was so ludicrous, but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke, and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, "OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2, but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before ."
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years .
Well, to conclude, I can say that we made a material using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines .
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them .
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries; denial of financial resources; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children, who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees, men, women, children, entire families in fact, were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust, while mechanically stacking bricks on their head, up to 18 at a time, and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution ."
If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts, and instead of thinking about information overload, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table and mock their responses, chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me, or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done, that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets .
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder .
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly, greedy creatures that are just after your flesh, associated with politicians . I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds, because they need our sympathy . They really do . And I'll tell you why .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them, and wants to be on their team, and stands up against the real bad guys, who are the men who want to abuse the women .
These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
With an amazing group of women, I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
Porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can just rain through it, so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides, and you have a road that's easy to drive on, so no splash water anymore .
In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks with things like alcohol and drug use; crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; unprotected, earlier sex; The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and costing our governments billions of dollars every year .
So, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world .
And first let me say, I recently joined Google's Moonshot group, where I had a division, the display division in Google X, and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google .
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test, if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines who are there, who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say, "I want to be on their team," because they're going to be on their team .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor .
So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses .
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train " and "The Talented Mr . Ripley," books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant .
But since publishing "Crazy Love," I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened, and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives -- as employees, wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like me .
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography, and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline, in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word "I " and how many times he uses the word "we ."
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard .
And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses, and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stairs, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway, poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview, I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
I'm wondering what you would say, especially to parents, but in a more broad way, to friends, to family, to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them, what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them ?
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was among friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions .
And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your walls are made of, because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live .
And yet, in this country, in the states of the Old South, we execute people -- where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
In game play, for example, in Go -- everyone remembers in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess -- fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of Go, arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor, has also started to succumb to computer game players
So, if the photographer is right there, the light is right there, like a nice HMI, and the client says, "We want a walking shot," this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times .
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago, bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl
And Ms . Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott -- amazing African-American woman -- and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr . King .
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them . Can you help us ?"
The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests, and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life, is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning, and transform it in some way, so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind .
Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing; sensors and networks; robotics; 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet; synthetic biology; fuels, vaccines and foods; digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A .I .
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear," so we've got a lot of interest, that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China -- I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together .
So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean .
That's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint
CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
Ladies and gentlemen, this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently, if women and men think differently, if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries, if they can break a few norms of family and society, if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states, which go against the basic human rights of the women .
At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U .S . embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds
When you come back to the shore and you say, "We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficulty, the human-performance aspects of working at sea," you can't explain it to people . It's that thing that maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets, and with these magnets, we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain, and using those, we can actually create holographic-like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns,
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess, who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
I mean, these people had nothing, and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up, but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere, and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own, so that now they do the same back-breaking work, but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it, and they do it in freedom .
It's a long story, but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms, is stories about the functioning of a system, its structure, its dynamics, the behavior it produces, great for solving the easy problems — how we behave, how we function — but when it comes to subjective experience — why does all this feel like something from the inside ? —
And the answer is, the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense: just like you would travel through a tunnel, a bottleneck in your future path space, in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on, or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerges directly
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words ": "Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me .
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity " is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability .
And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable, like this ugly little building in Spain, where the architects dug a hole, packed it with hay, and then poured concrete around it, and when the concrete dried, they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made,
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal ."
Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago -- the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .
So when you come to the game, you sign up, tell us where you live, and then we give you real-time news videos, data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs, what's not available, how food supply is being affected, how transportation is being affected, if schools are closed, if there's rioting, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life

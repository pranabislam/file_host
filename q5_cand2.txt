Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Yes .
No .
Okay .
Thank you .
Look .
Thank you .
Oh !
Okay .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
One person .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Here it is .
This is Al .
Less .
Not bad .
The sun .
Tree .
Not exactly .
Go !
Nobody .
Thank you .
Imagine that .
No .
There it is .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Yeah, good .
Thank you so much .
Oh my God .
AB: Thank you .
How about form ?
Here's the video .
You know what ?
Real school .
We were poor .
Yeah, OK .
Does it work ?
Thank you guys .
Creativity .
After a week .
Seattle .
What a fish !
Sort of .
Great .
Your daughter ?
The moon .
Wow !
Really .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Why not ?
No !
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
How do you do that ?
It feels good .
I understand that .
This is mine .
It was getting faster .
It's beautiful .
It was crazy .
Japanese .
Are you ready ?
Rick data .
Is that all ?
I represent the kids .
I swear .
Explore .
Notions that are very different .
I'm not kidding .
Not very sustainable .
Dreadful .
Your sister ?
Simple .
Everything changed .
These are elements .
Here's another thing .
Thank you . Thank you .
We lose them .
It's everywhere .
I don't know .
It would have been great .
That's a lot .
A larger number .
And here's a surprise .
Yes, there he is .
Why do we do that ?
I don't know .
It's personal .
It's something .
It's huge .
The answer is no .
Don't do that .
It's true .
The answer is simple .
The results came back .
We are the land .
But you know what ?
after a single trip .
Ohhhhhh .
Oh my God !
It's true .
Solar technology is ...
It's generic .
So they know everything .
You could see Manhattan .
These changes happen .
It opens .
Oh, this guy .
Robert Gupta .
It's horrible .
Play is essential .
My intuitions again .
I don't know .
We take off .
Bye . Thank you .
They are leaders .
He's pretty good .
Everything was extremely normal .
I'm with you .
I don't think so .
Ah, thank you .
Okay . Thank you very much .
They use their hands .
Look at this graph .
They do this .
But how do you do it ?
Thank you .
Do you ?
We all know that .
They called me .
That was us .
It's not ...
But many die .
Guess what ?
Or maybe not .
Nothing happens .
Is it conscious ?
What was the outcome ?
It's really interesting .
That's it . Thank you .
Scandalous .
Why do we do that ?
Is that your wife ?
It took 18 months .
So where do we go ?
That's great .
DK: 60,000 .
How do we know that ?
Terribly exciting .
The farm is incredible .
Ta-da !
They feel good ."
Why is this true ?
Who are really the best ?
That's the crisis .
Listen to understanding .
What would you say ?
This is the parapet .
This is what happens .
This is a mountain .
This is a tree .
You have a mouth .
It could take months .
You can be extraordinary .
We activate the communities .
1,000, very good .
Simple .
It has sensors .
Is that your opinion ?
But it gets worse .
Which is extraordinary .
CA: 60,000 .
It's really cool ."
Which I mean .
Trust is the answer .
How about longevity ?
This is the building working .
So who's normal ?
That's a lot of volume .
Extremely difficult .
I have a question .
There are always some .
Same thing, worse .
You say your truth .
I have to use words .
We're all conscious .
Let's do it .
So how does it work ?
That's her name .
Obi-Wan .
And the answer is no .
It starts a new life .
Extraordinary .
I was so scared .
Okay, a little bit more .
One is height .
But they do the work .
What do these people want ?
Did you see these guys ?
And that's important .
Who are these cousins ?
Ban is empty .
JK: Both of them .
That's great .
He liked a lot .
The game starts -- silence .
Superman can fly .
than the best in the world .
Urine dark .
The data is formal .
Not very common ...
I'm not for .
I have to mention it .
It makes our life difficult .
I know why it happens .
Why are you still there ?
Everything is going to happen .
You can see all this .
I met him .
He cried a lot .
Go read his book .
That's the goal .
They had to get out quickly .
This is Stephen Watt .
So here's another example .
Is it light ?
It knows where we are .
I don't think so .
Thank you very much, guys .
Tom: I'm Tom .
This is what happens .
Imagine that for a few minutes .
We can do all that .
I'm going to stop that .
Okay, here we go .
But what do we do with that ?
It doesn't really work .
You could model it .
with the symbols .
I like it .
You can make your list .
Or is that possible ?
Two things can happen .
Let's watch a video .
So I'm going to go in .
Like I understand that !
This is done .
We love innovation .
And they did .
That's not the case .
I felt great .
People were getting crazy .
What did they do ?
They don't get fed .
And it was fascinating .
Probably 10 times as much .
Why not live longer ?
I was stunned .
It keeps you fresh .
Just count it again .
And I did .
I really understand that .
My name is Amit .
For the last 10 years, actually .
I was very proud .
And here I am today .
There are three main groups .
Three out of 10 times .
There are billions of them .
We created centers .
I was collapsed .
And so Scott takes that call .
And that's nothing .
It's scary .
It's almost identical .
And it worked pretty well .
You can walk into it .
Here you can see the city .
They make money .
Be just yourself .
He had this experience .
I wanted to support them .
Because, you know what ?
Jack is our favorite ."
It's hard .
And he jumped .
One was Jason .
All right, ready ?
Why are we aware ?
And you like it .
But we need more .
I protested .
Not very hooky .
We have no infrastructure .
It was a big time .
And listen to this .
The only country in the world .
That's interesting to me .
It's completely run .
It's very risky .
And then he says three words .
How can that happen ?
Hi, everybody .
It really comes from artists .
You want to feed the world ?
Two and a half for one .
Let's call him Don .
Pretty good, right ?
How do we do that ?
I was quite extreme .
It doesn't exist .
That moment changed my life .
It never happened .
Man: Oh ! Oh !
Fans want to live this .
No, not that way .
I'm not my dad .
That's the son .
It was really brutal .
And I looked like this .
But there was a problem .
No Shakespeare .
It was a beautiful day .
My dream was getting real .
They didn't know .
full of understanding .
This is in Seattle .
It's part of our life .
We have to get the message across .
I'm an expert in relationships ."
Sounds incredible, right ?
So, you can do that .
That's the good news .
That's the criteria .
Dreadful, absolutely horrible .
Who do you have in mind ?
It's absolutely beautiful .
It was concrete .
My family believes in me .
This is what she says .
You hear that all the time .
Why should we do our goal with this ?
For a year . One year .
They must always be moving .
Then there's danger .
Who after us cleans ?
I want to make them public .
And I'll talk about that .
ML: Thank you, Tom .
It could even be your story .
She also had doubled .
You don't want to do that ?
Let's step back .
This is Jason Garber .
They were right, you know .
That's not enough .
They have less confidence .
It's Sunday evening .
She loves her reflection .
I thought I could handle that .
Everything is going to happen ."
So that's our reconstruction .
But reality is far away .
ML: Absolutely .
This young child is eight years old .
We need to create a new profession .
There are hundreds of them .
It was great .
I'm talking a lot about these questions .
Mark Bezos: Thank you .
It's easy, right ?
So imagine two more small changes .
This is one of the photos .
It turns out to be really hard .
So let's think of atoms .
Look what she does .
It was an amazing experience .
My cousins run around .
And it hits 257.
The second mistake was worse .
That's 45 meters by 3 .
But it's selective .
It's great time . Thank you .
Let's go to this project .
Let's start with Sunday .
But a game changes shape .
We should reach nine billion .
I could see in his eyes .
Thank you very much . RT: Thank you .
I'll summarize it all up .
So what happened then ?
Which I am, actually .
So what about that ?
Everybody liked me .
Remember that fire ?
Here's why .
And the path is still long .
I think it's exactly right .
She did it secretly .
Let me summarize it .
Think about your own choices .
How can we help you ?"
There were remixes .
There were still fish .
I sometimes go too hard .
She connected these two people .
So it's for real .
Your power plant can explode .
And then it gets even better .
But it was very sad .
Can I be honest ?
And I was an artist .
She can have fun .
We want that experience ."
This is Ohio .
You guessed it .
This is not 1961.
He eventually gets married .
We take pictures all the time .
I lost all hope .
We love entertainment .
BG: Thank you . Thank you .
I resisted it .
It turns the motors off .
So you can have this cloud .
You saw the big spike .
You can zoom on it very simply .
I grew up in India .
These are two very different notions .
"The best in business ."
We too can do it .
It's not a country .
And it's really amazing .
And it's been a great success .
They sell certificates .
The balloon is dedicated .
It was more entertaining .
And that got me thinking .
The hard problems are hard .
And then I did .
I had to go one step further .
It was embarrassing .
He said two things to me .
These girls were very lucky .
I was so shocked .
So I came up with an idea .
But they have different meanings .
Chris Schwuwe: Go !
And I got into play .
Okay . Open your eyes .
They're so easy to help .
Right ?
We're in great company .
The forest was amazing .
It also sells hope .
So I became a cartoonist .
Everybody did the same thing .
It looked more like a restaurant .
You can see the water coming in .
But I'm going to do a trial .
Ha . It's ready .
So they kill lions .
They kill our livestock .
Privacy goes for itself .
Why have you chosen medicine ?"
She'd come back and die .
And for sure, she was back .
They ended our inspiration .
This is not our fight .
That's not our problem .
Let's call him Don .
He can only use his eyes .
I've had a good life .
It's called the cloud .
You can play with a different guy .
Let's start with detection .
We went to a site .
So it's going to be hard for this solution .
Who can have that certainty ?
First of all, we have the population .
It was really, really deep .
I don't like that .
You can prevent suicide .
So this incredible story could be true .
And also hundreds of collaborators .
He actually says it that way .
His name is Paul Offit .
And that can make a big difference .
So what about this pancake ?"
I would have this difficult conversation .
And it was a horrible feeling .
I changed my doses .
Many are not that lucky .
Many are not that lucky .
You can see all of my steps .
My parents are approaching the 80s .
One: Be authentic .
What if you were that person ?
What do they have in common ?
This is Hollywood .
Books are always with you .
But it's so unfair .
That's one way of doing it .
We got to the camping .
One year goes on and on .
It's about all of us .
MK: I can help you .
We see the same symptoms .
And the potter was beautiful .
My name is Brian Goldman .
But, you know what ?
And he opens a map .
That was my first shot of sun .
There's good news here .
You're a great person .
We were disconnected .
So go ahead and invent .
Let me show you how it works .
We defeated it .
You've heard about it . OK .
It's a very simple question .
I don't know where we're going .
You see the little nozzle at the top .
I want to help calm you down .
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you .
Oh, my time is over ?
Many of my clients are very young .
It would be inadequate .
This is their confiture .
You happen to be right .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
That's 20 Central Parks .
And by doing that, who knows ?
So do you ever want to stop ?"
One hundred and four .
It's very time-consuming .
Hi . This is my cell phone .
This is a person walking around .
On the left we have a woman .
She's very much in her heart .
It doesn't happen that way .
Just like the people in this room .
You know what ? You're wrong .
I wander my sleeve .
It seems disproportionate .
Thank you, Daniel Kahneman .
But in practice, how do you do that ?
when it comes to what the subject would be .
So if we could turn on .
And it was "Pident ."
Yeah .
Something like twice as long .
They all matter .
Would you like it ?
All right, all right . All right .
With infinite grids .
The result was disastrous .
It may seem the opposite .
But I'm going to ask you one question .
They're on the street for it !
Everything is messy .
Thank you, thank you very much . Thank you .
Absolutely . I want to .
All of this comes from our pockets .
Even in our mobile devices .
They want to tell, they want to share .
And I thought about that .
Many of them drown .
So I got it all together .
And he said yes .
There are cybercriminals .
And then it happened again .
And the family got together .
And I felt really good .
Her mother raised her alone .
And then it became international .
You're still losing rare animals .
It will take you .
So I made one .
Well, I was the next one .
I see the symbol + .
Do I love color ?
There is no normal .
These questions are enormous questions .
It was tenacity .
I turned to the books .
The economy needs them .
Put it up in the air .
Today I am 22 years old .
Go home to where ?
I love things that are different .
She shares with other experiences .
And I went back to work .
And I memorized everything .
So what's next ?
We worked very late at night .
That's my grandfather .
He retreated to silence .
He was actually collecting fish .
Let me give you an example .
I'd written these crazy things .
I couldn't bear it .
They are there, doing nothing .
Man: Uh, my brand ?
I wanted to keep us healthy .
She did it for three years .
And that really changed the dynamic .
It's an ecological network .
There's almost nothing there .
We invented it in 2007.
There should be an understanding .
I could be like this person ."
They're working tips .
They never stop .
It finally has a purpose in life .
Would you have what to say ?"
And they don't want to be fired .
Well, it's very simple .
What happens ?
I think these are experts .
It's procrastination .
My dream would never come true .
So here's the goal .
It only took three days .
Would it be that simple ?
We're very proud of you ."
These are all important possibilities ."
What is it about ?
And we were live, you know ?
And why is this information here ?
What happens ?
This is a family portrait .
This person never was born .
The book was published in 2009.
And here I am today .
I live in South Central .
I thought my life was over .
Okay, a little bit of it .
That's cool, right ?
But there are two problems with this .
And these are neural structures .
That's not how it works .
We built an app for iPad .
What does that mean ?
Even cats watched this video .
Jimmy Kimmel actually did .
But it's not documented .
You should be asking for it as well .
Good evening ."
It spread virally .
In fact, I'm an engineer .
What other brands are like that ?
Isn't that great ?
And we then measure its movement .
And I never saw them .
He showed it in Javier .
Can we actually go this way ?
They had the notion of blue blood .
You have so much uncertainty .
And let me start with an example .
They flooded the canals .
And then implement it .
I'm asking you to visualize that well .
Science is not a business .
In fact, Paul is a terrorist .
Even the truth doesn't release them .
But there's another reason as well .
Never excuse that .
But we've met a new phenomenon .
It's no longer a free individual .
They want to be their favorite player .
So I go in a different direction .
It's a gas station .
That's a horse talking .
What are we going to be interested in ?
I want more searches like this .
What would that look like ?
This is a remarkable statistic .
They were looking for people like him .
Would I have become a terrorist ?
We present it to a young woman .
I didn't have the role .
All of this is possible because of this information .
Who sends out a text to whom ?
But don't get me wrong .
You know, I'm an artist .
It takes a moment to charge it .
Like me, they dream big .
We had the victory in our hands .
I don't tell the same story .
This is the system we have .
And they don't say much about it .
A very strange thing is happening here .
You can have a success story of change .
That was the sailboat .
"A pale blue dot ."
He went and kept coming .
And there's this amazing silence .
He was the first primate standing there .
Oops . Wait for a second .
They have to tell me about my brand .
And it's also very risky .
MS: All right . Great .
So that was the reason for the project .
I have something to show you .
But then you really want to go further .
And even Lomborg changed .
And so that's a big challenge .
He showed me the algae .
The chief had too cooked it .
And that was a big revolution .
Government ? Forget that !
Nobody knows what we're doing .
All of this is possible with your cell phone .
It's a little scary .
You can add your own examples here .
But it doesn't happen that way .
Let's look at the numbers .
11 . That's pretty good .
The seven nests become columns .
But it also deteriorates health .
The fans want to be on this terrain .
Oh my God ! Aaah !
Fans want to be on the ground .
Kevin's okay, as he says .
The world became a huge black hole .
So I couldn't stand it anymore .
I mean, I'm a journalist .
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
The shape is there for something as well .
Let me show you a little bit .
Not very good taste either .
We won a lot of prices .
So again, it looks really good .
Chris Anderson: I have a question .
The bricks have a color code .
This is the guy on the left .
And who could have predicted this ?
The more it changes, the faster it changes .
The seat of society is here .
What's next on your list ?
He really got sacred for us .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
I want to believe that Paulie was right .
That's how things get memorable .
But let's show our kids the truth .
I already knew how to identify .
I have lots of little examples here .
I'm going to go ahead and choose government .
We don't expect it .
It would be an entirely intuitive person .
So Scott was talking to anybody .
Let's go further into this analogy .
I've talked a lot about magic .
It's the work that's waiting for us .
We're almost able to do that .
There are also records of the world .
You know my answer to that ?
In fact, their life depended on it .
You cannot miss yourself .
You know what I'm talking about ? Yes .
I thought, this is incredible .
"What ? No . Why ?"
That's a double tragedy .
But what's the problem with this ?
Who would think something like that ?
So we have players here .
We have to cage this bear .
I don't know what to do here .
Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they don't .
It's all there . It's all online .
I really want to see a couple of them here .
The light is shining on Macaron .
You have to change the gangster script .
He was waiting .
So what's going on here ?
So what happened here ?
I've never been caught .
killing everybody inside .
and true no matter what your weight is .
It shows a rare white Elanion .
Come with me . Thank you .
"Yes," he said .
Then there's nuclear .
So this is a wish .
One is South Korea .
Is it just about imagination ?
Some arrived and left .
I'll never forget it .
I'll never forget that .
And many people forget about it .
So how does this happen ?
He died in history .
Or is it photography ?
Was we followed ?
So I broke the silence .
This was the first one .
So why did they go there ?
What else could they bring about ?
So I just started playing .
And finally, a heroic sense .
They're celebrating ."
Now everybody is talking about happiness .
You haven't changed the story .
It doesn't work for emotions .
And this is a video in real time .
Everybody applauded politically .
That's where this picture comes from .
Italy wins . Yeah .
It cost 2.7 billion dollars .
I did prison -- hard .
Woman: A higher technology .
They were always happy in some way .
And that made me sad .
It's happening at home today .
I have nothing to hide ."
And I said, "Yes ."
Talk about what you've heard here .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
Just because it sounds really good .
You know when you expect them to be seen .
We'd believe ourselves in a novel .
I think there are three .
Now, in third place, the task .
They both lived three temptations .
So try to achieve that level .
That's what suicide does .
We talk about it ambivalously .
It's just better than reality .
It's true . I believe it .
They build a heroic story .
People were suffering . They were fighting .
This is the Sans Essence World .
He shook his head, "No ."
I could draw . I could paint .
And with that, I thank you .
The increase was constant .
It's a little crazy .
Monday, color is powerful .
And you actually do the same .
This is a photograph of the object .
You see some cool stuff coming up .
Both of these will be irresistible .
LEGO made it accessible .
This is a modest little app .
I mean, it's fascinating .
I mean, it's fascinating .
It's not our burden .
And I started telling him everything .
I call it the billion in growth .
She wasn't drowned yet .
So I followed my intuitions .
And that's what I felt .
And he was really, really sorry .
The abuses thrive with silence .
And I was really upset .
In the cold, windy night .
What does slow light look like ?
Take the time to say thank you .
Jalousy loves photos .
It's absolutely rational .
I gave homework .
He didn't start this trend .
Why do we have these inner movies ?
I said, "What speech ?"
I just wanted to slide you a word .
Aid exists . Hope too .
What would we be able to do then ?
The machines would rise against us .
We have measles in this country right now .
No one had told me that before .
You can zoom in on a particular year .
Everybody wants to make others happier .
So what do we have to do ?
It takes more funding for research .
And I have to leave the city .
You can be logical and intuitive .
This is the morning, before the game .
Raise your hand . Show me .
Who doesn't want a healthier child ?
No, I thought so .
But what this picture represents was the problem .
A: Tell me about this world .
And that was 19 years ago .
And you know what I learned ?
So litteBits is open-source .
I work in the solar technology industry .
We didn't write that app .
We actually live in an extraordinary period .
Let me show you a simple example .
But it requires a lot of planning .
I'm a redefined doctor .
What do you do with certificates ?
We can repeat this cycle several times .
Well, you can see where it's going .
We're not working at offices .
They had their title of respectability .
Now, I can do the fish .
That's having an impact on society .
So what does jealousy like ?
The old novel in this field .
We could go to Mars if we wanted to .
But I didn't manage it .
Three trees, we have a forest .
Two suns together, prosperity .
So we saw almost 30 characters .
It's our very first architect .
These are not trivial activities .
I'm not here to inspire you .
What would it look like on the ground ?
We lost hundreds of schools .
Let me explain .
And you know who we love ? Jack .
We're trying to avoid impact .
It disturbed me so much .
Music is medicine . Music changes us .
What we want to do is invent the future .
And I see Greg Lemond now .
Daniel Kahneman: Sure .
And then, what do you do with waste ?
Each iceberg has its own personality .
We don't have that kind of situation .
And here you can see Roberto dancing .
So we can rebuild an entire movement .
The goal of this film is transparency .
Tell me a little bit about that part .
So it takes all its senses, it sticks .
That's about one percent of the population .
The game is not just a child .
... looking at crowdsourcing .
Politics doesn't change; government changes .
And we had some fantastic presentations .
And that's a very sensitive question .
I believe it for every single person on the planet .
It's a game called Foldit .
We have the tools with this exponential technology .
I didn't know the protocols .
For a year, we were unfeeling .
We're right at that transition moment .
I'm human . I make mistakes .
I still romanticize silence today .
It has an unpleasant memory .
And, you know, it could have worked .
This story tells us three interesting things .
What if we took a dead nature ?
"She's on hold or what ?"
I'm not really sure what the answer is .
That's really bad for the worker .
And their work allows us to do our work .
They're almost a form of comfort .
jealousy is exhausting .
And, of course, it's hard .
You decide your life now .
I've met a lot of very interesting people .
This is my niece, Stella .
Science, by nature, is objective .
It's over . It's gone .
It's like a potato .
He'd had 20 minutes of fantastic music .
This is the recording of two patients .
A lot has to happen at the same time .
I have it on my laptop ."
That wouldn't have been a problem .
I want to tell you how we discovered this .
A lot of people gave up on the government .
And it worked . Okay, Scott .
There's a very good reason for that .
It's about the nuances of human language .
And this leads to a big question ...
Here you have the Apsaras .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
Like the president of a jury .
Kofi embodies the possibility .
And I wonder if it actually works .
Here's a story about what can happen .
Yeah, I know . What a eclecticism !
Imagine you're quarterly .
There's a lot of techniques in this approach .
It's more than that, deeper .
The best remaining remains -- in a second .
It was my humble experience on that .
But then reality is still unpredictable .
And I'll admit to you something .
We have the passion for autonomous innovators .
I didn't know how to talk about wine .
We harness the energy of the sun .
The second patient had a diarrhea .
And nobody seems to make it a story .
It takes a long time to imagine a building .
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective .
This is the updated version of that input .
These are all the useful information .
There must be another piece of the puzzle .
Otherwise, they're not coming to talk to you .
Hello, TEDWomen, is that okay ?
There are step instructions .
A: Which one do you want to talk about next ?
Your niece ? Your friend ?
Remember something ? Perfect .
It's from an old study .
What defines a story ?
I remember my first fire .
He showed me his throat over and over again .
So what happened ?
who meets Mohammed Ali .
My friend had accompanied me .
But I never got a role .
And it's architecture .
What would it look like ?
So why is this important ?
What do you think happened then ?
What do you think is going to happen ?
I almost never keep it in the kitchen .
I think that's really cool .
Keep going . Have fun .
This data wasn't available before .
How many people would choose creativity ?
How many people would choose the memory ?
All adults knew the risks .
I lived in parallel worlds .
It had never been a question of saying no .
We asked, and nobody knew .
It's not given to everybody .
Let me tell you a secret .
There was no service port .
My big break happened in 2010 .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
Other teams did the same .
And then what happens ?
You fought for a right cause .
Are you always smart or not ?
You thought the Internet was big .
It has nothing to do with science .
Let me read you the entrance .
Maybe we can think of it as change .
And women made these ideas successful .
Will there be my height ?
Apparently, it was quite popular .
I shouldn't say that .
That means something built in a city .
And why not live longer in healthy ?
Imagine an airplane full of smoke .
The white lines are the population .
Sometimes perspective is the illusion .
It's called the average stick .
And in addition, it gives you strawberries .
These are bird mixers .
We work in collaboration with local communities .
And I thought a lot about death .
They have no comparison point .
Other heroes can become invisible .
Every time I use my cellphone ?
But it's not just about me .
But his story took another turning .
Jalousy loves information .
Jalousy loves details .
Freud will write about it later .
We live in a time of envy .
There are no models for them .
Do you know Britney Spears ?"
And maybe we know one of them .
They work because they make you work .
The fact that I do .
You know what he told me ?
He said, "You've listened .
I think we all have cabinets .
Do not take anything for accounting money .
Why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine .
The object of this tower is pretty simple .
I hold the knife in my hand .
Yes, it was an absolutely remarkable experience .
That's the one that has the biggest impact .
Chris Anderson: Thank you . Thank you .
So we can make a gift .
But I don't buy anything new .
You want to walk around the museum ?
That's to complete the experiment .
Sex reproduction comes in .
I was trying to keep the body .
What are you going to do with it ?"
It's the two-century tour .
MS: That's a fantastic question .
It didn't make any sense to me .
Play is not frivolous .
They didn't give up on the government .
Would you like to come and listen ?"
Crisis . Death . Death .
Something hardened for me .
My mother asked us to touch her hand .
The defeat would have come too easily .
Who could never wish it to themselves ?
Now we do the same with airplanes .
Rives come from various places .
But I kept doing my job .
They put it on a ventilator .
You can't get rid of it .
Third technique: category .
We helped 40,000 companies launch .
The technologies to do this don't exist .
He wasn't alone when he started .
Some just wanted to call it King .
So we started to remove pictures .
You have to fight for her every day .
So Mohamed lives here an opportunity .
I wanted to understand who is in charge of the task .
jealousy makes me puzzled .
The Bible is interesting, but strange .
Two women together, it's a argument .
Then follow me in your kitchen .
And who do they inspire ?
Why does this inner movie exist ?
Can you do that with a backside ?
And his voice was a very powerful voice .
And you'll see a very strange phenomenon .
Another important consequence is the search for purpose .
There was never such a time .
This guy in the middle . Almost the same .
It's cruel to millions .
They divided the realm into two .
Amazingly, he was always delicious .
What is the ratio of food conversation ?
To celebrate ? I was completely lost .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
We have something that doesn't climb .
So here are natural fireflies .
Conflict is the genesis of creation .
That's something we could do .
Both are viable; both work .
They're at the back of our bodies .
They can even bring with them funding .
They become like free-living computers .
I learned that everything changes in a moment .
Karen Frank: We're a little brand .
KF: That's a great question .
So we start with a Windows drug .
But wait, this is my favorite project .
And these women would come together and talk .
So there's a possibility to change that .
And this is in a basic transfer .
It knows how we hold it in our hands .
I fixed it at 300 pounds .
And so each drop was a little bit different .
So it feeds on itself .
I thought the first one had a real calculation .
They had 348 kinds of confiture .
And my neighbors heard about this idea .
I thought my heart would explode .
And make that spike your favorite weapon !
I still take the pictures .
I couldn't help them directly .
This is just virtual reality .
This is the scariest thing .
Each of us here must go .
My grandparents went up to 70 .
It took me a while to understand it .
Because we don't want to move genes ?
I don't have that feedback in life .
We don't want to try to predict the future .
Let me give you a glimpse .
Climate change is going to be terrible for them .
And ice is sometimes over 100,000 years old .
And it's not just about sex .
I only wish I could see my children growing up .
And that was the beginning of ALS .
Thank you guys very much . That was great .
You know how many people are watching these TEDTalks ?
I'm going to deal directly with the artist .
And we want to make it accessible to everybody .
My mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
We don't really know much about this .
We don't like to talk about our history .
I said, "I'm going to listen ."
And the contributions we cannot predict ?
This is very important for medical research .
Here each piece is perfectly planned .
This transition is underway . We feel it .
It's a complete refus of mistakes .
And it starts with a doctor at a time .
They are our natural midden workers .
Tell us why your science is about us .
I wasn't a citizen of this country .
ML: That's much better than that .
Incredible indigenous people were guiding us .
But there's also a fun thing .
Oh, yeah ! You're awesome .
This audience is going to do it, I think .
And who's going to make the most money ?
It's a lot to hold in 18 minutes .
It's an amazing multi-pistic movie .
They do nothing extraordinary .
We need to learn to cross that step together .
Don't give them false hopes .
It's hard to exaggerate destruction .
Above, the line of happiness is absolutely flat .
So what potential do we want to reveal ?
So sex has many different variants .
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
This is where we were, and this is the picture .
He took four and a half years in Italy .
And it all made sense of the world for me .
It's Natanza, and Natanz only .
This is a short video of what we do .
We need to revisit the mechanism of governance .
That kind of shame teaches you something .
These are two different jewelry parks .
Grab your dish, gangster !
I'm just a woman with a story to tell .
It wasn't a brothel per se .
Hi, TEDWomen, how are you doing ?
They don't work the way they should .
The books forbidden in China, of course .
So we end up with buildings like this .
Eventually, we're not in opposition anymore .
I'm a pure, hard material scientist .
They're not just going to die from measles .
You're right . Let's have the problem .
This is the problem I'm trying to solve .
What does it look like from here ? Not bad .
It's really old, and it's used .
The rest of the time, they're out .
The game is the glue that holds us together .
I didn't know how to use the lanes .
Only shameful and unsustainable .
The sleep deprivation is really generalized .
I want to introduce you to my brothers .
I don't know if you've heard about it .
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes .
The bad news is that the majority don't work .
This work is extraordinary . It's great .
You don't know where it's going to land .
They need it and they don't get it .
His parents were actually slaves .
He shares it without reserve and yet .
We just wait for you to want them .
It opens up the path to its scientific study .
But I think we're not going to solve it .
How do you get augmented reality ?
Edward Castronova is an economist .
To make a difference, you have to do something .
That's my flesh and I can turn .
Let me tell you in a second .

3530 lines of information .
The World Health is coming soon .
It's worth billions of dollars a year .
in your neighborhood, be a mentor .
To the implication of the customer .
Why should I worry ?
This is how the adventure started .
What creates illusion ?
And then somebody complained .
People were seeing something magical .
Not just synonymous with "want done it ."
One of these projects is absolutely needed .
I love really cool clothes .
We talk about the wars of water .
He needed it to feel protected .
Remi knows what love is .
They hire perfect people .
Everybody asks the smell question .
It's a great source of teaching .
I never would have expected that .
We're opening this building in 1997.
But my daughter never complained .
And that got me very excited .
So that correlation is low .
The disaster would be for these two billion people .
The roof is also covered with water .
What would you like most about that ?
Just as widely as possible .
Today, there are 2.3 million .
Because we live on a water planet .
We're going to live on extraordinary decades .
This is a dead turtle .
My mother phoned a few minutes later .
Every morning, I climb on it .
But there's an unintended twist .
And it gave them an evolutionary advantage .
I started feeling a little bit better .
But today, it's way beyond that .
We didn't define our priorities well .
So why did I do that ?
But most people disagree .
Disability is as visual as race .
But I like to have an emergency solution .
We chose to go to the moon .
We chose to go to the moon !
Are you trusting fishers ?
He was only three at the time .
photomontage is part of the routine .
How do we take the next step ?
Architects and engineers, thankfully !
What ? It shook me .
How are you going to feed the world ?"
We're talking about being drowned under data .
This is a painting that represents a circle .
So that's what we did .
Let me tell you a little bit about that .
The summer was a chance -- 2006.
These are the results that we just got .
I wanted to restore health from the disease .
So I guess that's my brand .
People seem to think that politics is sexy .
They had to worry about being bombarded .
We are constantly hitting each other .
And I thought I could fit in .
And once we took a living one .
Life had not changed for centuries .
That's all it can do basically .
I actually made two other mistakes .
These three words are, "Do you remember ?"
And fortunately, he didn't die .
We need to increase complexity gradually .
and were making false certificates .
Privacy is not negotiable .
I started a new life again .
Where am I ? Who am I ?
I got tired of seeing all that .
The question is, "Why does she stay ?"
That should be the first principle of aid .
There's a problem with community meetings .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
So I started a research project with them .
They wear uniforms in many cities .
In the past, we've solved some big problems .
I have no big picture .
Well, we can do that for ourselves .
The comparative reading has nothing new .
So I started reading books by two .
This is a guy named E .P .
Well, let's give him more voice .
Good luck for this week . Vicky ."
This kind of thinking isn't new .
Ask any of my people .
It's their story, not yours .
They manage the process, they understand the process .
Anybody take their vitamins this morning ?
We've done them in the last 11,000 years .
Why ? Genetically engineered food .
This is a classic emotion for a player .
Wonderful productivity . I like this idea .
The back has something to do with it .
Not me, but this guy was getting there .
Flamingos eat shrimp .
Antony: healthy, strong, capable .
Unfortunately, it's not much better .
We'll come back to those people later .
I call it the hot tiger .
Now, let me give you an analogy .
You look at all these museums .
It's called "Talk to Me ."
I wanted us to live long and healthy .
We've reached some sort of balance .
Make it possible -- everyone in this room .
And that's what these brands did .
And that word is said with such a conundrum .
I know it could be broadcast widely .
And yet, there is this disconnect .
Well, I think our identity is at risk .
We're trying to reduce the prison population .
It just taught me very simple things .
I think this possibility exists all around us .
We've seen it with cell phones .
And the fishes were also happy to be there .
This is a graph that shows what it looked like .
And in some ways, kids don't .
I'm here to share my approach to photography .
Record them . Lessons the rest .
Introducted maybe mutations .
These are dark and weird programs .
Who are they supposed to actually inform ?
This is a problem of freedom opposed to control .
I realized the problem is the solution .
The noise will also disappear in these pores .
A microwave is a similar system .
Let's see . Yes, it worked .
So what's the problem with the vents ?
The first question you have to answer is, what then ?
I couldn't give them money, nothing .
We're male, gray creatures .
Can we really store all this information about us ?
I have brain paralysis !
And you can train young people to become entrepreneurs .
And then there's stigma .
And that would be a completely sensible reaction .
That's not what I would aim for .
Anyone to teach me ? Perfect .
A map is just somebody's perspective .
Two fires together, and it's very hot .
Some people say that a science of consciousness is impossible .
This is not an explanation science .
These are not things that are related to our bodies .
How do you create augmented reality ?
You take the balloon and you pull back .
So hard conversations are not my strength .
This guy was a hero: Jonas Salk .
It's not necessarily a bad thing .
When I move, my finger changes place .
But I didn't let myself in .
It's impossible to perceive it properly .
It follows the experiments from one after another .
And if you ask what happens at those times .
It's very, very important for us to get there .
On the left, you can see a little boat .
So I think we need to be a pioneer .
But just replace cities with buildings .
We've been here for about 130,000 years .
How could we do it ?
No hospital can say no .
See, I had this idea for a movie .
The film hasn't even been distributed yet .
And finally, we have to embrace transparency .
So he gets citizens to stand on it .
I'm tired, as we all do .
Jeopardy is not an easy game .
They came to maturity about five centimeters .
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
I didn't know how to talk about anything .
This will soon be available next week .
That's the farthest we can go .
Writing DNA was an interesting step .
Because the picture's made it more real to you .
"I don't help you," he said .
This is the sample coming out of the oven .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
We have to work with governments at the regional level .
And of course, everything in Africa was growing beautifully .
Think about death makes your life clear .
Something about words, I guess .

These are the first public health guards .
It was known as the palace of memory .
The bodies cannot be properly buried .

But, it's still a science of correlations .
My prayers with you in your fight .
If you know you're gay, tell it .
Here are some examples of Antarctica in action .
Suppose we had a machine here .
I have to say I don't understand .
They live in a chemosynthesis environment .
But I'm going to focus on the demonstration .
I want to show you one thing here for the first time .
This guy's called TEMPT .
So I spoke at a conference two months later .

We've made many, many ways since that time .
Jason's parents had asked him to do it .
And the gay reference battle started .
But you know what we can't do ?
We shouldn't . Our healthcare system is bad .
This is a problem that many players have .
We'll see ourselves several times over the next few days .
I don't see any reason why it works otherwise .
He flew all the suspicious hope .
It was seen almost 50 million times this year .
We all have navigation instruments in our cars .
They need an environment to be able to do that .
It makes no sense .
So I had to figure out a way to solve this problem .
Let's go back to that town .
And I started talking to some participants .
They just use their bodies to the best of their capabilities .
I have to say I'm not one of them .
Can't count my fingers there ?
It didn't work, economically .
You do something that's actually a little bit different .
So it's extremely difficult to do all these extensions .
That's over 250,000 acres .
And you can see this sort of green dot in the center .
So it has a nice game dynamic .
We see very interesting developments in our work .
30 years ago it looked ridiculous .
It supports those who talk about their mistakes .
Thank you very much, I'm free ."
In the 19th century, to build museums .
Speaking on its own, it has a limited impact .
The members of the group came from different horizons .
So I think we're out there .
The only story that matters is what you want to write .
Many great books were written about this .
So we see this all over human life .
For example, it would be an entirely logical person .
So I want to get in this machine and move on .
I'll do it to you and then explain it to you .
And I said, "Yes, ma'am ."
Well, it wasn't an angle .
We victims need everybody .
And I tried something interesting .
Since then, we've had several thank you .
But every time, I was lying there .
I'm going to show you an example of what I'm talking about .
It literally covers two and a half weeks .
You can see, but you can also look away .
Because I have to think about my image every day .
I admired .
You don't have to mobilize a expensive staff .
What makes this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
Having a good memory, it's learning .
They literally pulled the switch .
But what do you eat your fish ?
By burning coal, the answer is no .
And what happened years later ?
Will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
I represent people on death row .
So what happened that day ?
It's a story that's not finished .
And so we looked at the reverse effect .
One of them was this grandmother .
Did they know where we live ?
But no adults liked this idea .
So what happened to Emma ?
Do you remember what it was ?"
But there's something amazing happening .
Architecture evolves rather quickly, actually .
There's simply no privacy left .
We actually overcome testing .
There were several cases where it was really just .
Do they do that for the little ones ?"
Seriously, I was in shock .
If you burn natural gas, either .
People need to feel good about this .
What should our road map look like ?
The entire building is water composed .
How do you get it taken away ?"
We love technology . We love creativity .
They had been dubbed genetically .
I've never experienced it in real life .
"You haven't let it go ."
And I kept repeating myself the same questions .
I even went through a crisis of identity .
I'll never forget that morning .
Today, I only have one demand .
Anyone else would like it too .
The goal is to have more trust .
And it wasn't social intelligence .
I call these eight characters of the radicals .
Bad people are overloaded from information .
It was called Talibanization .
The players are not sitting still .
Five million people use it every month .
I thought, you know, something like two percent .
They did it by draining land .
One billion people will be hungry today .
And it completely changed the way I make films .
You can go directly to a specific number .
They were getting closer to a naturalist concept .
And that also involves new choices for leaders .
Well, that's not quite true .
You zoom in . You go quite frankly .
France marks . Italy marks .
These instruments are not available to everyone ."
The captain signed me up .
But maybe that's not the case .
We think about energy shortage .
That's it, and that's it .
But so many people over the years have been helped .
Because evolution could now happen in an individual .
I remember that as if it was yesterday .
Afghanistan seems so different from America .
I even considered some of these to be my second house .
My player told me their stories .
Can we see it entirely in 3D ?
Toc, dude . Anybody here ?
This film completely captivated its imagination for months .
At that time, I also had a son .
These people must be nature's anomalies .
The bakers have flour on their hands .
There's actually no shortcut .
We created an emotional response to these forms .
Every mayor in the world have .
They were men for whom I had respect .
It has emotions: anger and happiness .
They didn't want to hit neuroscientists .
But it's not yet augmented reality .
It distinguishes the good of the bad teams .
They just want their suffering to stop .
We just need to increase resolution .
Thank you . So imagine 20 years ago .
Well let me give you some blood .
"Absolutely," I said .
And ecologically, it was a disaster .
There are lots of techniques of coaching happiness .
What are the emotions that you can quantify ?
The world today has 6 .8 billion people .
The Internet and web services are a miracle .
And finally, there's this storage problem .
So two couples each designing a child .
Thursday: self-confidence is the key .
There's one more part of the story .
Here's another look at the tree of life .
The first is that we will not evolve .
It's kind of our battlefield .
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
Man 3: I'm the pets guy .
In the opposite case, Stuxnet does nothing .
And in this case, a neighbor saw it .
It's really an extraordinary honor for me .
And then my brother started staring at me .
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable .
We just passed the seven billion on Earth .
He just wanted to share an rainbow .
And I actually become a character in this book .
So I think the basic notions are pretty simple .
Maybe we'll produce the new George Washington Carver .
So actually, I was in a very good company .
The ripples should get closer to us .
His village is near Mogadiscio .
I brought together some 90 young Somali leaders .
I wanted to know them as individuals .
We forget how sorry it is .
I started imagining what that might look like .
But my tiger mom said, "No ."
Three suns are sparks .
One person behind Japan, what do we have ?
There's nothing like that on Earth ."
In fact, I have a memory on the average .
Small windows, dehumanizing size .
That's the problem with postmodernism .
What gets them to do that ?
But the boys are not immune to that .
And we're not doing it with age .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Even a photon has a certain degree of consciousness .
"Only it's in the hall ."
The ideal girl must be very quiet .
Can I have a pancake, sink ?"
Think about it . It's an incredible fact .
Ask questions, require evidence .
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday .
We can fix this machine on whatever we want .
It was great, but I was in love .
And every night, they will do another 250 kilometers back .
And I told them to fund an expedition .
And we started planning these expeditions .
Well, again, we should have both elements .
Those arguments are very few .
So, it's not just a story of words .
It was summer . I was wearing shorts .
Intersexuality can take many forms .
I mean, what am I going to find today ?
Now imagine being on an airplane without any sound .
MS: How would you describe your brand ?
The first one here is the classic, Apple .
Or are you more than a passive attitude ?
And this is the scenario behind Stuxnet .
It's actually more dangerous and aggressive .
And this is actually a conservative estimate .
It ended every single argument in our family .
Tell me what you're trying to do ."
If you generalize this, something like this happens .
So you don't lose plentiful animals .
And of course you can find fast-food .
And try again to do that for another generation .
I was an obsessive compulsive student .

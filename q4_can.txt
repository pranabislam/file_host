Look at that .

Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Yes .
Don't .
Fantastic .
Ah !
Thank you .
Thank you .
Really .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
I don't know .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
That's her .
They didn't know .
It's weird .
I don't know .
It's true .
My answer is no .
That's a wish .
Okay .
You know what ?
Why ?
Thank you very much .
You can think about it .
It's true .
Oh ...
It's true .
What happens ?
Thank you .
This is Alice .
This is not ...
Thank you .
It feels good .
That's us .
Okay .
Thank you .
Thank you .
That's it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
No .
Thank you .
Ooh !
Thank you .
But there's a problem .
That's architecture .
And it was very successful .
I don't think so .
I don't believe that .
But here's another thing .
No back door .
No comparison .
Go !
What happened ?
That's it .
"Man ."
This is a road .
No .
But maybe .
Like a child .
It's beautiful .
It's even months .
How positive are you ?
One more time .
They're photos .
We love entertainment .
That's it .
Be an example .
What do you think ?
It's normal .
They know everything .
I was shocked .
What about health ?
It happens .
That's my story .
Your niece ?
"God ."
It's all raw data .
It's a real school .
We are poor .
Is that true ?
Life is over .
A few .
A week later .
Exploring .
They called me up .
We all know that .
Are you ?
Your daughter ?
Your sister ?
A human being .
"Moon ."
What do they want ?
There is no choice .
He's fishing .
I can't stand it .
Well, thank you very much .
Very dangerous .
I grew up in India .
It's a challenge .
This is an ecological network .
I want to ask you a question .
It's amazing .
Let's do that .
Thank you . Thank you .
I feel happy .
Why not ?
There's fish there .
It's perseverance .
It affects you .
I thought about this .
It's scary .
This is acceptable .
A lot of people .
That's great .
You can enter it .
This is very important .
Yeah, that's it .
What would you say ?
This is steel .
Your wife ?
It's a deception .
The answer is no .
But we need more .
Know where we are .
Here's another example .
Well, some .
No, no .
This is me .
He screams a lot .
What happened ?
That's the rule .
I don't do this .
This is a picture of it .
I've talked a lot about it .
It hasn't drowned yet .
I love detail .
We're going to try to catch up .
At three years old .
That's what happens .
People .
Thank you .
It's terrifying .
Yeah . Oh .
I am .
No joke .
From Seattle ...
That was 19 years ago .
A range of changes happened .
That's all possible .
So I'm going into it .
This is the post-modern .
That's not the problem .
There's a switch .
They even have cell phones .
In my work .
What did they do ?
And they got married .
You can be extraordinary .
Thank you very much .
The answer is simple .
We are soil .
But you know what ?
What's going on here ?
That's our prison population .
It makes you feel new .
That's great .
It's a terrible sound .
He opened the door .
Look at a video .
I made this .
There was no feed .
They're just as important .
It's very exciting .
Robert Gupta .
It's a terrible thing .
And the data came out .
And I can understand that too .
Is she conscious ?
It's crazy .
"The Japanese ."
Are you ready ?
He's actually waiting .
Everybody liked me .
What's the problem ?
What happens ?
No one else ?
I represent children in the courtyard .
My name is Archimedes .
We're flying .
They built the center .
I'm sad .
I will never forget .
And this is very important .
It works very well .
How about Ban ?
So we started moving .
But it's sad .
Is this just imagination ?
A little bit more .
He loved it .
You're looking at cities .
I saw this +5.
18 months .
What do you do ?
Just be yourself .
One is Korea .
I feel awe .
How do we know ?
This is an ancient study .
"It's," he said .
I want to support them too .
I really don't understand .
It's this simple exercise .
I did an interesting experiment .
She can go out and play .
One is Jason .
Are you ready ?
Why do we have consciousness ?
I refused .
He never got there .
They're still alive .
The world is unique .
I'm interested in this .
And he said something .
He's on the engine .
What about longevity ?
Good afternoon .
It really comes from these artists .
So forgive me .
Not a country .
I have no opposition .
So what does this work ?
How do we get there ?
People should understand it .
But I refused .
But then something else happened .
It's more entertaining .
I'm not my father .
I looked like this .
These are tricks .
Baker's name .
He started a new life .
It's not easy .
This guy doesn't exist .
My friend is with me .
Actually, 10 years .
He told me two things .
I was terrified .
I feel proud .
They sell certificate .
One: lower .
Right ?
I don't like your questions .
It's better than reality .
Not a lot, not a lot .
It felt bad .
You think the Internet is big .
I know why people do this .
It's really interesting .
In Seattle .
Why ?
I think they're experts .
Here's what it looks like .
A continuous story .
You hear it all the time .
It's okay .
His life had goals .
Listen to me .
The most important thing is passion .
But try it .
The point is .
So what's next ?
Or is it about light ?
That's my grandfather .
He silence .
That's me !
This is Sunday evening .
This is a holiday community .
This horse would speak .
What do they have in common ?
That's Hollywood .
Very rational answer .
But I love the emergency program .
I love photography .
jealousy like information .
This is an astonishing number .
We'll be fine ."
We need to send messages out .
Let's see .
ML: That's how it works .
We see the same symptoms .
But a lot of people don't think so .
Don't get me wrong .
These are nervous structures .
And then it opens a map .
He hangs up .
It's called the digital cloud .
You can do it differently .
It turns out it's very difficult .
I think we all have a closet .
But there's another reason .
It's very simple .
So what do we have to do ?
That's what we did .
So I said, thank you .
What would you do ?"
And I think this is my brand .
I don't know .
Look what she's doing .
Ah, wait a minute .
This is a monolithic fish .
Two things happen .
You're right .
That sounds scary .
The shortcut doesn't exist .
Let's be part of it .
That's all impossible .
I'm a journalist .
I said, "Yes ."
And it's not good enough .
We didn't have that .
This is part of the story .
Let me explain that part .
It's an honor to be here .
That's a pretty good question .
I didn't know the agreement .
And it's free .
Arabic .
This is not consciousness science .
It's just virtual reality .
That's not a bad thing .
We don't like to talk about history .
No speech .
And of course, fast food restaurants .
I'm not a citizen of that country .
There's nothing wrong with these things .
We keep building .
There's the world record .
All of this makes a positive difference .
I love strange things .
I felt moved to America .
We use the power of the sun .
This is a picture of the day .
Education .
I don't know what to do .
Maybe not here .
This is in London .
It has sensors .
It's really long .
This is a tree .
Don't do that .
I learned from the book .
Dry .
We take photographs a lot .
It's everywhere .
I was so cold .
Why am I worried ?
And I did .
After one trip .
Where do you go back ?
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
Solar technology is ...
That's enough !
But it gets worse .
You can see Manhattan .
These changes are happening .
BG: Thank you .
Thank you very much .
That's cool ."
Can I be honest ?
His job was great .
But what happened ?
Nothing happened .
I felt great .
Maybe nothing changes .
We love innovation .
I swear .
Yes, OK .
We have three main groups .
I had to use language .
These are tough .
The difficulty is the hard problem .
What makes a difference ?
How is his story different ?
Basically nothing .
My dream is about to happen .
Many people drowned .
Are we tracking ?
These girls are lucky .
I was shocked .
Today, I did .
Everything is ready .
And his answer was yes .
We have online criminals .
This is Ohio .
But they can do the task .
How did this happen ?
I work a lot sometimes .
And I will never forget that .
Have you seen these people ?
I remember my first fire .
And she did .
It doesn't exist .
Here's a little surprising .
But that's not true .
It's exciting .
And this is what happened 16 years ago .
The crisis was coming .
He went down .
By listening .
How many memories do you want ?
That's what I want .
I agree .
These are very important choices ."
She did come back .
It's kind of like this .
They let us lose our inspiration .
It hurt me .
They work hard every night .
People know the danger .
Let me give you an example .
And look at this curve .
Because this is not our problem .
I love novel things .
I love great suit .
We want health .
The ball is from orbit .
This is what water architecture does .
You can see the peak time .
You can shortly contract .
I think this is really cool .
Oh, thank you .
This is a picture of it .
But at least we need one .
But what do you eat ?
2.5 is good .
"The best in the industry ."
What's going to happen ?
We can do that too .
So I started playing the violin .
And guess what ?
Is it predictive ?
I have to say this .
They have this concept .
It's not a hard time .
You cannot judge it .
Let me start with an example .
I can draw .
I'm just a relationship expert ."
This is "The Oil World ."
That's what the data says .
He did .
So these are the good news .
I'll talk about it .
This is not something everyone can do .
But a lot of people aren't that lucky .
You know what I mean ?
But how do we do that ?
Think about the standards .
Why are you staying here ?
That's called procrastination .
We're proud of you ."
What happened to her ?
It's all open .
Remi knows what love is .
Let me tell you a secret .
I had to get it .
What do I want to observe ?
It's called the shot rate .
I think anyone can do it .
"You never let go ."
Come with me .
Okay, let's see .
It was the first time I was sunburned .
Now there are several good news .
So I went to the courtyard .
You have to learn something .
So let me start with the story .
That's an idea worth spreading .
It's cool, isn't it ?
It's easy, right ?
Only his eyes can move .
I made some mistakes .
That would be irresistible .
What do you want ?
You can always jump .
I can't say that .
You see something interesting .
This is one of those images .
We measured its movement .
The truth is, I will .
That would be the biggest impact .
He said, "That's success ."
He referred to algae .
The goal is very simple .
It's human shoots .
Let's take a step back .
Don't apologize .
The principle is: Truth .
There are help and there are hope .
He said, "You listen .
You retreat into your pocket .
And then I thought a lot about death .
I said, "What speech ?"
But they were right .
It's not enough .
That's what symbolism means .
What have they learned ?
We chose to go to the moon .
We live in a time of jealousy .
You can see my footprint .
That's our model rebuilding .
This little boy is eight years old .
Today I just want one thing .
It's too easy to fail .
Hey, this is my phone .
Let's look at these waves .
The translator tells me their story .
But memory is selective .
It was a great revolution .
We can repeat it over and over again .
What do you do with a certificate ?
This is Leonardo dawn .
That's the system we have .
It's a little strange .
Let me give you an example .
We should add research assistance .
But so many years of help .
That's it, just that's it .
We have conflicts over and over again .
I said, "Great basking ."
They didn't give up government .
You know what I learned ?
It looks like an insurgency .
I've been trying to keep it .
It's a kind of recreational experience .
Let's think about atoms .
CA: Thank you .
But now I can reverse it .
But there are exceptions .
It also includes creating social impact .
You've actually had that experience .
But I didn't .
This is a person walking .
But it's not .
Take statistics .
These are not trivial things .
And there's also damage to health .
I know what you're thinking .
It doesn't feel good .
Let's see the video .
Ask me what I didn't do .
I couldn't afford to .
Let me demonstrate .
That makes us very disappointed .
But we will create the future .
Let me bleed you .
And finally, the storage problem .
There are things we need to know how to do .
It's behind us .
Everything changed suddenly .
And that's how they do it .
Consider the public .
My brother stared at me .
We want to reduce prisoners .
I think we can help .
He's the one on the left .
What's your next plan ?
He was so cold .
Well, my memory is pretty normal .
It was inevitable .
You hope you won't .
So you can't assemble a mistake .
This is a very important medical study .
Now I've been talking about magic .
And then you take different pictures .
That's how much we can achieve .
I think it's very useful .
For two reasons .
The fuel problem solved .
Of course, I remember .
It made a difference in my world .
We have to participate in government systems .
Thank you very much for coming to TED . Thank you .
Oh, wow !
Don't say I'm normal .
There was no window .
That's why architecture like this exists .
It's not just measles .
Here's all the metadata .
Those two things fit together .
There's a nanotechnology .
We all know what breadmen are .
I think this direction should change .
What a beautiful fish !
Different views .
It did stop .
Remember fire ?
But the point is .
They ran crazy .
You get the data .
But I don't know if people can accept it .
He did this experience .
So I had another idea .
What needs help ?"
Mothers are raising themselves .
He died as history .
And then go international .
They made the remix version .
What you lose is a rare animal .
Scott got the phone call .
And that's just a small number .
The power plants explode .
Even better matching .
Some of them go away .
Then people went back .
The game starts -- quiet .
Would it be the color I like ?
Does it sound good ?
Our favorite Jackie ."
There are all kinds of problems .
I have a personal life .
Most people die .
Now everything is different .
People loved buildings like this .
This is a mountain .
This is a word .
It's not 1961.
I haven't found it !
Now I'm 22 years old .
These guys are making money .
Ten ? Very good .
AM: Thank you .
Maybe 10 times more .
You're talking about yourself .
I had everything under my back .
We're everywhere and nobody knows .
I live in a parallel world .
This is not our struggle .
They use their hands .
It's completely ambiguous .
Man: My brand ?
I went to prison -- hard .
I've met him .
So you get clouds like this .
She did it for three years .
You want to feed the world ?
They're having dinner ."
She could be a media person .
Only two of my favorites .
But soon somebody complained .
I was so extreme .
Man: Oh ! Oh !
I'm not that guy ."
No, it's not like this .
We are all conscious .
He had no dogs .
It's a beautiful building .
Now, they are leaders .
That got me thinking .
Trust is our response .
No Shakespeare .
It was a very good day .
But I never got a role .
So I broke my silence .
By the way, thank you .
It's always dynamic .
Architecture is growing very rapidly .
And it became my joy .
You can't even try it .
" Remember what the word was ?"
Okay, open your eyes .
My dream is no longer possible .
Why does it choose its target ?
We have such great partners .
But is that simple ?
It comes from fiction .
One year . All year .
Why would I choose to enter medicine ?
Everything is under the naked eye .
Now, Superman can fly .
ML: Thank you Tom .
It's more like a restaurant .
Sounds amazing, right ?
So the plan has a blind zone .
But these two words mean different things .
You read it yourself .
Do they know where we live ?
This is Stephen Wolfram .
I went back to work .
So it's very low correlation .
And then something very interesting happened .
But what about the future ?
Let's start with the sensory phase .
It was really popular .
You actually do the same thing .
He showed it to Harville .
So think about it for a minute .
But that's more than that .
In fact, adversity is part of our lives .
Who guarantees it ?
Let's start with people .
There is no privacy .
Do they do it for children ?"
No, he shook his head .
And this creates a historical story .
Because it doesn't matter .
The result is very different .
And they implement it .
What about a pottery ?"
Everything you did before .
So what happens ?
suicide is inevitable .
That's the result of suicide .
But that's still not acceptable .
But what if you were that person ?
It doesn't belong there .
Oops !
What will this future look like ?
There was no opportunity at all .
Will I be a terrorist ?
But it's not just me alone .
We have to create a whole new career .
I got mad .
The garden is beautiful .
That's how I felt .
How do I get it out ?"
But, you know what ?
We developed an iPad app .
But what can we do with it ?
And this is not recorded .
This is a dead sea turtle .
The white line is population .
That's great .
We love technology . We love creativity .
It's not our own problems .
I should say, very powerful .
I mean, it was very powerful .
But I don't buy anything new .
We didn't write this program .
Data takes time .
The conductor called me back .
They need to tell their brand .
It's not that easy ."
This is what we see .
Next stop, the game is over .
You see the timeline .
Let me introduce you to this .
I have something to show you .
There are two ways of getting in, very simple .
It feels good .
They promote the concept of naturalism .
But I had to leave the town .
This is a circular picture .
You can go straight into a period of time .
They took the water out of it .
No one ever said that .
Smart -- what is it ?
But we also have a new phenomenon .
You know what he told me ?
Just to give you a message .
What to do next ?
The whole thing is very expensive .
Think about how you consume architecture .
One of them is called E .P .
These people must be gifted .
I had a son .
It's not new reading .
Well, we can do that for ourselves .
We can go to Mars if we like .
We've solved some of the big problems .
What do jealousy like ?
Fast forward . Thank you .
Can we figure that out ?
Many of my reports were young .
There's a problem with community conferences .
I don't think so .
I was tired of these realities .
And there is no information .
But it does take a lot of planning .
Now we can do the same with airplanes .
Who doesn't want it ?
I thought I could fit into the local community .
I thought it was primitive .
"The light blue dot ."
That makes no sense .
These are the people I once admired .
They want to end their pain .
I teach liberation .
It's not that rare .
Just increase resolution .
Thank you .
That's their story, not your story .
We need to prevent collision .
They're people like this room .
It really hurt me .
And then I saved my leaders .
Let me show you a closer look at this .
How do emotion measure ?
So we start on Sunday .
This is a picture of a tree of life .
I learned very simple principles .
He whispered in my ear .
He just wanted to share a rainbow .
Please give me some clips .
I don't know why kids are no longer collecting .
Put the lights on .
Maybe some mutations are introduced .
They're abstract . They're odd .
So it's self-expression .
We're on the turning point .
See, really, fix it .
He had great memories .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
NASA even had a proposal .
That's not the goal .
This is the most terrifying thing .
Can you bring me the crackers ?"
Because we don't want to move the genome ?
We don't try to predict the future .
Well, there are two parts .
This is a ship of about 15 feet .
We have no idea what it is .
I can see fear from her eyes .
Thank you very much . That's great .
Or the low-end brand ?
I'm going to talk directly to artists .
It's not even launched .
This is a conservative estimate .
At first I thought we were playing games .
We don't really know that history .
It's tired, like everybody else .
BL: There are many opportunities .
Here, these are the sky .
This is what it looks like today .
This is how the gun used .
But something interesting is happening .
Who here has a cell phone ?
I can't understand my behavior now .
They went because it was a big thing .
Many institutions have this reverse response .
This is the job facing us .
It's called the memorial palace .
Imagine being a quarter of a sanitary pad .
There are a lot of technologies out there .
Don't let them have that illusion .
Why do they do that ? Why ?
I said, "What are you talking about ?"
Because they didn't know what was going on .
You don't talk about wine .
It's not a brothel .
Exactly .
That means that patients themselves can do it themselves .
But they can't solve big problems .
It just explains the problem of Silicon Valley .
Of course it's Chinese banner .
It becomes as big as cities .
So we ended up getting these buildings .
"Are you a boy or a girl ?"
What does that look like ? Good .
shrimp eat plankton .
It was the beginning of the movie .
How many memories do we use ?
We call it the digital waterfront .
No other country .
I'm going to talk about a very small concept .
I don't know how to use knives .
We have navigators in our cars .
You see, these images are not particularly special .
You wonder if it works .
Don't say I'm normal .
I think their job is high .
I don't know if you've ever heard of it .
So I started interviewing people .
You don't know where it's going to land .
And then I thought, let's be honest .
What you do is actually slightly different .
It's eternal . It's always eternal .
And I decided, open it up .
70 percent of the time, not working .
That's good . Don't stop .
We built art museum in the 19th century .
This was the 1980s . It was cool .
The main problem here is AIDS .
What changes are you doing ?
I got in the car .
They laughed at their friends .
They can light your entire book .
We have to change the definition of rogue .
It might take a whole village effort .
It's getting faster .
And then I would go, just listen .
Now this is the experience of self and self .
At the end of the three months .
It's food for the poor .
Many of them have dropped out .
It's like we've been preparing for this .
Thank you . That's great . Thank you .
John Kamen: Yes .
We are losing them .
A little bit more .
Think about the choices you make every day .
He kept pointing to it .
There are billions of transistors .
What causes this illusion ?
My intuition worked again .
Okay, so here we go .
Play is essential .
What are these close-up animals ?
So what is the murderer ?
People were crazy .
So where are we going to go ?
How do you define good ?
The fishery is amazing .
Why does this happen ?
Who did the best ?
These are big questions .
"We want to feel it again ."
So what's going on ?
Why not live longer ?
So this is what it looks like .
This experience is unforgettable .
There's almost nothing left .
She would share her experience with others .
It's dying .
It costs 27 billion dollars .
Now, how did this happen ?
How many people would choose creativity ?
It doesn't work before .
Keep going . Be happy .
So what happened a few years later ?
This video is taken in real time .
People have been talking about happiness recently .
They basically move the cards .
Let me repeat the point .
The game was made in 2007.
And finally, the meaning of poetry .
That moment changed my life .
So what would that look like ?
Everything is normal .
So why are they going to the moon ?
And my conspiracy was over .
It's always origins .
